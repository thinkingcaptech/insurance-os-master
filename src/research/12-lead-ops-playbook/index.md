# The 2024-2025 Lead Generation & Agency Operations Playbook

## I. Executive Briefing: The 2025 Strategic Pivot
- **TCPA One-to-One Consent (Jan 27, 2025):** Ends “marketing partner” loophole; requires agency-named consent; $500–$1,500 per violation.  
- **Trigger Lead Ban (H.R. 2808, Mar 5, 2026):** Ends mortgage trigger leads; forces MP shift to partnerships and proprietary intent signals.  
- **Core pivot:** Proprietary funnels + compliance-first tech (provable consent, opt-outs, 10-yr recording). Agency value = exclusive, verifiably-consented leads + owned database.

## II. Final Expense (FE) Lead Generation
1) **Facebook/Meta (HEC limits):** Creative-as-targeting; CPL: Exclusive $15–$40, Shared $4–$15, DIY as low as $9; close 2–8% if <5 min; shared/aged 1–3%.  
2) **Direct Mail:** $0.45–$0.85 per piece; response benchmarks 3–5% (letters up to ~8.38% vs postcards ~2.79%); per-responder ~$30–$60+.  
3) **Aged Leads:** $0.30–$3.50; <1–3% close; viable only with automation + compliant dialer.  
4) **Live Transfers:** $40–$100+; 5–15% close; best for strong closers.  
5) **Door-Knock:** Follow up mail/aged; route planning; empathetic scripts.  
6) **Referrals/COI:** $0 CPL; 30–60% close; formal program with reminders.  
7) **SMS:** High-open; TCPA minefield—requires written consent + one-click opt-out.  
**FE Lead Source Snapshot (2024-2025):**  
Facebook self-gen CPL $9–$40, 2–8% close, <1 min SLA, High TCPA.  
Direct Mail ~$30–$60/return, 3–5% response, 1–3 days, Low risk.  
Aged $0.30–$3.50, <1–3% close, Very High TCPA.  
Live Transfers $40–$100+, 5–15% close, Medium.  
Referrals $0, 30–60% close, Very Low.

## III. Mortgage Protection (MP) Lead Generation
- **Trigger ban:** 2025 is last build year before Mar 5, 2026.  
- **Intent Signals:** Equity check, listing browse, CMA request, affordability/refi tools → database nurturing instead of bought triggers.  
- **REA/LO Partnerships:** Embedded agent; systematized referral value (co-marketing, rapid quotes, education); warm referrals convert 15–25%+.  
- **Digital (HEC):** Optimize to funded loan CPA; upload offline conversions; CPL secondary.  
- **Costs/Conversion:** Fresh $20–$100+; aged 30–59d $6–$12, 90+d $2–$5; aged conv ~1%; REA/LO 15–25%; self-gen nurture 30–60%.  
- **Cross-sell:** Use P&C/book intent signals for compliant MP outreach.

## IV. ACA Lead Generation (Regulatory-Driven)
- **OEP 2026:** Nov 1, 2025–Jan 15, 2026 (Dec 15 for Jan 1 effective).  
- **Subsidy expiration end of 2025:** Message panic/choices.  
- **SEP/QLE:** Medicaid unwinding, job loss, move, birth, divorce.  
- **Compliance:** 10-yr consent-to-contact; 10-yr call/virtual recording (Medicare/ACA); virtual meetings included.  
- **Ads & Naming:** CMS policing misleading names; short-term “junk” plans must be labeled.  
- **CPL/Conv:** CPL ~$41.60–$53.53; ~11% conversion; operational efficiency + Help On Demand for free, high-intent referrals.

## V. IUL & Whole Life Lead Generation (High-Value Funnel)
- **Market:** Record IUL growth ($3.8B 2024); premium growth 2–6% in 2025.  
- **Education-first:** Webinars, guides; lead with 3–4 yr cash value reality.  
- **Webinar funnel:** 90% teaching, 10% CTA to strategy call; nurture non-bookers.  
- **HNW/COI:** LinkedIn Sales Navigator, CPAs/attorneys/tax advisors, SmartAsset-type vendors.  
- **Nurture:** 6–12 months; sales cycle 30–90+ days.  
- **Conversion:** Purchased 2–3%; self-gen/nurtured 5–10%.

## VI. CRM and Technology Systems
- **CRMs:** AgencyBloc/Better Agency (insurance-specific); Salesforce FSC/HubSpot/Zoho (general-purpose, integratable).  
- **Dialers:** Compliance-first; PowerDialer.ai, Nextiva, JustCall, PhoneBurner, Five9; must support TCPA/DNC filters, logs, recording.  
- **Marketing Automation:** ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, Act-On; required for sub-1-minute auto-response + long nurture.  
- **Lead Distribution:** Auto-route by license/product/availability; Blitz or CRM workflows.  
- **Stack suggestion (best-of-breed 2025):** HubSpot/SFDC + compliant dialer + ActiveCampaign + HIPAA-compliant 10-yr storage for calls/meetings.

## VII. Lead Management Best Practices
- **Speed-to-Lead:** 5-minute mandate; goal <1 minute via automation; average industry 47 hours = unforced error.  
- **Follow-Up Cadence (sample 10-day):** Instant text/email; Day1 call+VM+email; Day3 call+email; Day5 call; Day7 LinkedIn (IUL/MP); Day10 breakup email.  
- **Lead Scoring:** Demographic + behavior; automate in CRM; AI scoring case study up to 96% accuracy.  
- **CRO:** A/B ads/forms (fewer fields can +120% conv), emails, scripts; personalize first contact.  
- **CPA Benchmarks (general life):** Organic ~$24.96; Paid ~$37.44; blended ~$29.95.  
- **ROI Channels:** Email ~$42:$1 ROI; referrals 300–400% → paid leads feed owned list; profits from nurture/referrals.

## VIII. Compliance Gauntlet (2025)
- **TCPA One-to-One (Jan 27, 2025):** Agency-named consent only; shared/vendor leads non-compliant without proof. Opt-out by any reasonable method; honor within 10 business days → central CRM mandatory.  
- **DNC Scrub:** National every 31 days; state lists as applicable; vicarious liability (Hossfeld) = agency liable for contractors → require approved stack.  
- **Recording/Docs:** MA/PDP and ACA calls/virtual stored 10 years; ACA consent to contact stored 10 years.  
- **Data Privacy:** New state laws (e.g., CA SB 354, NY Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure); tighten data handling/sharing.

## IX. Benchmarks & Market Trends
- **Growth:** Life premium record 2024; total life projected +2–6% in 2025; IUL primary engine; WL +1–5%; VUL +5–9%.  
- **Product Matrix (2024-2025):**  
  - FE: CPL $4–$40; conv 1–8%; cycle 1–7d; $50–$100/mo; TCPA risk.  
  - MP: CPL $2–$100+; conv 1–25% (aged vs partner); cycle 7–30d; $100–$300/mo; FCRA/TCPA.  
  - ACA: CPL $41–$54; conv ~11%; cycle 1–10d; $30–$60/mo commission; CMS consent/recording.  
  - IUL/WL: CPL $25–$100+; conv 2–10%; cycle 30–90+d; $5k–$15k+/yr; NAIC marketing risk.  
- **Competitive angle:** Leading FMOs (SFG, PHP) differentiate on proprietary tech + leads.

## X. Vendor & Tech Recommendations
- **Leads:** Multi-line (SmartFinancial, Datalot, QuoteWizard, EverQuote, Hometown Quotes); Health/ACA (Benepath); Aged (Aged Lead Store, Leads Warehouse); HNW (SmartAsset). *Re-vet all vendors for one-to-one consent warranty.*  
- **Tech:** Core CRM (HubSpot/SFDC/Zoho), Insurance CRM (AgencyBloc), Dialers (PowerDialer.ai, Nextiva, JustCall, PhoneBurner), Marketing Automation (ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp).  
- **Dialer costs:** ~$18/user/mo (entry) to $175/user/mo (enterprise).

## XI. 90-Day Implementation Roadmap
- **Days 1–30 (Compliance & Tech):** Legal review vendor contracts (one-to-one); select CRM/dialer; implement 10-year recording storage.  
- **Days 31–60 (Funnels):** Launch FE Meta + IUL webinar funnels; stop trigger-lead buys; start REA/LO outreach (10+10); implement <1 min auto-response + IUL nurture.  
- **Days 61–90 (Enforce & Optimize):** Mandate compliant stack usage; pre-OEP ACA messaging (subsidy expiry); build live dashboard for CPL/CPA/conv by product/source.

## Notes on Templating / Stack
- Eleventy + Nunjucks is suitable; you already use Nunjucks layouts.  
- For search/index: consider Eleventy + lunr/elasticlunr client-side index or Algolia DocSearch; keep front matter consistent (tags/status/title).  
- For structured reuse: break this into data-driven partials (NJK macros) for tables (lead source, product matrix) and roadmap cards; use `_data` for shared lists (vendors, benchmarks).
