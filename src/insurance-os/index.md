# Insurance OS Master Plan

The Insurance OS is a scalable, compliance-first operating system for life insurance agencies. It brings together proprietary lead generation, rigorous regulatory controls, and a modern technology stack so owners can generate high-quality leads, protect their licenses, and grow profitably.

Built for multi-line agencies, the system aligns playbooks for Final Expense, Mortgage Protection, ACA, and IUL/Whole Life with the infrastructure required to stay audit-ready (TCPA, CMS, DOL/NAIC, HIPAA/GLBA). It packages recruiting, onboarding, training, compensation, and tech operations into a single, day-mode workspace.
