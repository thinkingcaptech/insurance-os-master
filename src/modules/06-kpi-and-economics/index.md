# Module 6: KPI & Economics

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

This module contains the "math" of the agency. It translates the agency's goals into a **predictable, non-negotiable set of daily activities**. It provides the core conversion funnels to answer the most important question: "What must I do *today* to hit my income goal *this month*?"

This system moves an agent from "hoping" for success to "engineering" it. It is the central management tool for leadership to diagnose and coach performance. If an agent is failing, this module provides the data to find the *exact* stage of the funnel that is broken (e.g., low dials, low contact rate, or low close rate).

## 2.0 Core Economic Components

* **[KPI Architecture (Activity Funnels)](kpi-architecture/):** The core "Activity-to-Production" funnels for FE, MP, ACA, and IUL. This is the agent's daily roadmap.
* **[Agency P&L Benchmarks](agency-pnl-benchmarks/):** The Profit & Loss benchmarks for an agency at three stages: Solo, Growing, and Enterprise. This defines "what good looks like" at the business level.
* **[Technology ROI](technology-roi/):** A framework for analyzing the cost vs. return of the core tech stack (CRM, Dialer, Leads), ensuring that technology spend accelerates, not drains, profit.
