# Playbook: Technology ROI

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

Technology is an **investment, not an expense**. Its purpose is to increase profit by:
1.  **Increasing Efficiency:** Generating more revenue from the same (or fewer) inputs (e.g., Speed-to-Lead automation).
2.  **Decreasing Risk:** Preventing catastrophic, six-figure compliance fines (e.g., Compliant Dialer, Call Recording).

The benchmark for tech spend in a growing agency is **2-5% of Gross Commission**.

## 2.0 ROI Analysis Framework

### 1. CRM ROI

* **Cost:** ~$150/mo per user.
* **Return (Efficiency):** A 1-point increase in close ratio (from 15% to 16%) on 50 appointments per month = 1 extra sale.
    * `1 sale * $900 AP (FE) * 100% FYC = $900/mo`
* **Return (Risk):** Value of a centralized, auditable system for proving TCPA/CMS consent.
    * `1 TCPA Lawsuit Avoided = $50,000 - $1,500,000`
*

### 2. Compliant Dialer ROI

* **Cost:** ~$140/mo per user.
* **Return (Efficiency):** A 25% increase in daily dials (from 120 to 150) = 30 more dials.
    * `30 dials * 40% contact * 30% appt set * 70% hold * 15% close = 0.37 extra sales/day`
    * `0.37 sales/day * 20 days/mo * $900 AP * 100% FYC = $6,660/mo`
* **Return (Risk):** Value of universal call recording and time-zone-aware dialing.
    * `1 CMS 10-Year Record Audit Passed = Priceless (Agency survival)`
*

### 3. Marketing Automation ROI

* **Cost:** ~$50/mo (base).
* **Return (Efficiency):** "Speed-to-Lead" automation increases contact rate on new leads by ~10%.
* **Return (Nurture):** "Lead Recycling" workflow reactivates 1% of a 5,000-lead "dead" list.
    * `50 reactivated leads * 40% contact * 20% appt set * 70% hold * 10% close = 0.28 sales/mo`
    * `0.28 sales/mo * $900 AP * 100% FYC = $252/mo`
*
