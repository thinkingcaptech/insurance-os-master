# Agency Growth Systems

## Summary
- Structural alignment drives scalability: hybrid hub-and-pod model with centralized support is recommended.
- Recruiting funnels must be high-volume yet quality-filtered; onboarding is a 30-day sprint; retention hinges on cashflow stability and career paths.
- Compensation and training must reinforce compliance, activity, and persistency.

## Key Benchmarks
- Recruiting funnel (job boards): 100 applicants → ~1 active at 90 days.
- CPH: $2.5k–$7.5k; Cost of Failure >$12.5k when training/support included.
- Onboarding goals: license in 7–10 days; Week 4 set 10 appointments.
- Retention: industry 1-year ~50% failure; good agencies target 30% retention at 3 years.

## Compliance Notes
- Licensing/CE tracking (product-specific); AML/BI/Reg BI; TCPA-compliant outreach in recruiting.
- Documented onboarding/training; supervision and file audits for suitability/replacements.

## Scripts/Processes
- 30-day onboarding sprint (license → tech/compliance → role-play → go-live appointments).
- Daily huddles/role-play; weekly 1:1s for <1-year agents; activity-led KPIs (dials, conversations, sets).
- “Realistic opportunity” recruiting messaging to reduce churn.

## Action Plan
- 0–90 days: Pick structure (hybrid hub/pods); implement 30-day onboarding play; realistic messaging; consent-compliant recruiting outreach.
- 6–12 months: Launch training allowance/forgivable draw; dual career paths (manager vs top producer); LMS-driven training with QA/role-play.
- 1–2 years: Build specialized pods; refine compensation for persistency; continuous performance coaching and compliance audits.
