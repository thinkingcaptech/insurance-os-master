# Module 5: Agency Growth Systems

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

This module provides the systems for scaling the agency's most important asset: **its people**. An agency's growth is constrained by its ability to systematically **Recruit, Onboard, Train, and Compensate** talent.

Most agencies fail to scale because they treat recruiting as a primary goal. In this OS, recruiting is secondary to **systems**. We first build the "machine" (Modules 1-4) and then recruit people to *operate* the machine. This solves "Agent Drift" by plugging new talent into a proven, step-by-step process for success.

## 2.0 Core Growth Components

* **[Recruiting](recruiting/):** A systematic playbook for attracting qualified, licensed, and unlicensed talent using proven ad funnels and outreach scripts.
* **[New Agent 30-Day Onboarding](onboarding/):** A non-negotiable, week-by-week "zero-to-production" roadmap. This is the new agent's first, most critical task, managed in the LMS.
* **[Training & Development](training/):** The systems for continuous improvement, including daily role-play, live call coaching, and leadership development pathways.
* **[Compensation](compensation/):** A clear, transparent, and scalable commission and override hierarchy that aligns agent incentives with agency profitability and persistency.
