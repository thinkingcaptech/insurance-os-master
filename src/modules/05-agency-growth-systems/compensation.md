# Compensation & Retention

## Summary
- Comp drives behavior: advances/chargebacks risky for new agents; training allowance/forgivable draw stabilizes cashflow.
- Dual career path: manager (overrides) vs. top producer (higher comp/equity/specialist bonuses) to avoid promote-to-failure.
- Recognition and activity-based rewards aid retention; culture + compliance over toxic top producers.

## Key Benchmarks
- Training allowance example: ~$500/week for 3–6 months; fast-start bonuses tied to early premium.
- Vesting: captive models use vesting as “golden handcuffs”; IMOs pitch day-one vesting.
- Industry retention: ~50% fail in year 1; aim for 30% retention at 3 years.

## Compliance Notes
- Avoid misleading income claims; document comp disclosures; watch chargeback debt risks.
- Ensure replacements/twisting discouraged via persistency metrics and clawbacks.

## Scripts/Processes
- Fast-start bonus: e.g., $5k premium in 90 days → $2.5k bonus; tied to activity KPIs.
- Training allowance track for risk-averse candidates; advances for experienced with persistency proof.
- Recognition cadence: daily/weekly public activity wins; monthly results; align with accountability.

## Action Plan
- Design two comp tracks (allowance/as-earned vs. advance) and dual career paths; publish transparently.
- Tie incentives to activity + persistency; monitor chargebacks and intervene early.
- Remove toxic high-producers who violate culture/compliance; reinforce recognition and career mobility to retain talent.
