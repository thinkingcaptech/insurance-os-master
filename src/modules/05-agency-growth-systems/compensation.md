# Playbook: Compensation

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

Compensation is the clearest signal of what the agency values. This plan is designed to be **simple, transparent, and scalable**. It must align incentives by rewarding two things:
1.  **Personal Production:** The agent's ability to sell.
2.  **Profitable Scaling:** The leader's ability to recruit, train, and *retain* productive agents.

This model is built on **commission advances** for cash flow (FE/MP) and **overrides** for scaling.

## 2.0 Agent-Level Compensation (Example)

This is the starting "street level" commission for a new agent. These levels are tiered and increase based on lifetime production (e.g., $100k, $250k, $500k in issued premium).

| Product | Street-Level FYC | Advance | Chargeback Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Final Expense (FE)** | 90% - 100% | 75% (of 9 Months) | **High.** 100% clawback of advanced commission if policy lapses in months 1-9. |
| **Mortgage Protection (MP)** | 100% - 110% | 75% (of 12 Months) | **Medium.** High persistency (85-97%) makes this a superior cash flow product. |
| **ACA Health Plans** | $20 - $27 PMPM | None (As-Earned) | **Very Low.** No advance = no chargeback. Builds a stable, compounding annuity. |
| **Indexed Universal Life (IUL)** | 70% - 80% (on Target) | Varies (e.g., 50%) | **Severe.** Multi-year chargeback liability (e.g., 100% Y1, 90% Y2). Agents must be capitalized to handle this. |

## 3.0 Leadership Override Compensation

Leaders (Tier 2 and 3) are paid an **override** on the production of their direct team. The override is the *spread* between the leader's commission level and their agent's commission level.

* **Example:**
    * **Agency Leader Contract:** 120% (on FE)
    * **New Agent Contract:** 100% (on FE)
    * **Override Spread:** **20%**

* **How it Works:**
    * New Agent sells an FE policy with $1,000 Annualized Premium.
    * **Agent Commission:** $1,000 * 100% = $1,000 (paid by carrier)
    * **Leader Override:** $1,000 * 20% = $200 (paid by carrier)

* **The "Vesting" Mandate:** To align incentives and reward retention, overrides are only paid on **issued and persistent** business. A leader whose team has poor persistency (high chargebacks) will have their overrides clawed back, just like the agent. This forces leaders to train for *long-term, good-fit sales*, not just short-term production.
