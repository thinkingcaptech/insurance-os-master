# Onboarding

## Summary
- 30-day sprint aimed at momentum, not mastery: license fast, set up tech/compliance, role-play, then live appointments.
- Managerial support via daily check-ins and structured practice; goal is first “win” and activity habits.

## Key Benchmarks
- License: 7–10 days targeted.
- Week 4 goal: set 10 appointments (Project 100 warm market).
- Daily cadence: check-ins, role-play, huddles.

## Compliance Notes
- Cover AML, E&O, suitability/BI, TCPA basics during onboarding.
- Ensure contracting, background checks, and CE prerequisites completed; record consent to training requirements.

## Scripts/Processes
- Week 1: pre-licensing scholarship + exam.
- Week 2: tech stack access, compliance modules, build Project 100 list.
- Week 3: scripts + heavy role-play; Week 4: go live with supervised calls/appointments.
- Buddy + dedicated coach (not top producer) for day-to-day support.

## Action Plan
- Publish 30-day plan with daily/weekly KPIs; assign coach; schedule role-play blocks.
- Pay pre-licensing scholarships; ensure tech/CRM/dialer/logins on Day 1.
- Track progress in LMS/CRM; intervene quickly if milestones missed; celebrate first appointments/wins.
