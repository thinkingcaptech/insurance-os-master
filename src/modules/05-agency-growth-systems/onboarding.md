# Playbook: New Agent 30-Day Onboarding

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

This is the most critical 30-day period in an agent's career. It is the system designed to combat "Agent Drift". The goal is not to just "train" them, but to build **unconscious competence** with the core systems (Scripts, CRM, Dialer) and achieve the **first "win" (a close)** as fast as possible.

This entire playbook is structured as a course inside the **LMS (Module 3)**. Access to leads is *contingent* on graduating from Week 1.

## 2.0 The 30-Day Roadmap

### Week 1: Systems & Scripts (No Leads)

* **Focus:** Master the tools and the language.
* **KPI:** 100% LMS completion, pass all script certifications.
* **Checklist:**
    * [ ] **LMS:** Complete Module 3 (Tech Stack) & Module 4 (Scripts).
    * [ ] **LMS:** Pass "TCPA & CMS Basics" certification quiz.
    * [ ] **Roleplay:** 2 hours of mandatory group role-play *every day* (FE & MP scripts).
    * [ ] **CRM:** Log in, set up account, and practice logging 10 "dummy" leads.
    * [ ] **Dialer:** Log in, set up account, and practice "click-to-call" from the CRM.
* **Gated Check:** *Agent does not get access to leads until they are 100% certified on scripts and systems by their manager.*

### Week 2: First Dials & Appointments

* **Focus:** First live contact and booking appointments.
* **KPI:** 100-150 dials/day, 5-10 appointments *set*.
* **Checklist:**
    * [ ] **Dialer:** Live dials in the "New Agent" aged lead pool.
    * [ ] **Rhythm:** Execute the "Daily Operating Rhythm" (Module 7).
    * [ ] **Roleplay:** 1 hour of mandatory group role-play *every day* (Objection Handling).
    * [ ] **Coaching:** Manager live-listens to 1 hour of calls via dialer (whisper/barge).

### Week 3: First Close

* **Focus:** Running appointments and getting the first application.
* **KPI:** 5-10 appointments *held*, 1-2 closes (applications).
* **Checklist:**
    * [ ] **Quoting:** Master the quoting tools (Module 3) for FE/MP.
    * [ ] **Sales:** Run all scheduled appointments.
    * [ ] **Coaching:** Manager must "ride along" (listen in) on the first 3 live appointments (via Zoom or phone).
    * [ ] **Roleplay:** 1 hour of mandatory group role-play *every day* (Closing).

### Week 4: Production Consistency

* **Focus:** Building a repeatable, consistent weekly rhythm.
* **KPI:** 1-3 closes, building a predictable funnel.
* **Checklist:**
    * [ ] **Full Cycle:** Agent must now manage the full cycle: Dials -> Appts Set -> Appts Held -> Closes.
    * [ ] **KPIs:** Agent must log all activity in the CRM and review their "KPI Dashboard" (Module 6) with their manager.
    * [ ] **Graduation:** Agent graduates from the 30-Day Onboarding and moves into the full-time agent pool.
