# Recruiting

## Summary
- Portfolio sourcing: referrals (highest quality), targeted “unhappy pros”/veterans/experienced sales, job boards for volume.
- Messaging shift: from “unlimited income” to “realistic opportunity” to reduce churn.
- Treat CPH as investment; minimize Cost of Failure, not headline CPH.

## Key Benchmarks
- Funnel: 100 applicants → ~25 screen → 10 first interviews → 3 contracted → 1 active at 90 days.
- CPH: $2.5k–$7.5k; Cost of Failure >$12.5k including wasted support.
- Pass rates: Life-only ~62% nationally; TX Spanish Life ~27% (needs targeted prep).

## Compliance Notes
- TCPA-compliant outreach; clear disclosures in ads; avoid deceptive income claims/testimonials.
- Licensing/eligibility checks; background checks per state/carrier.

## Scripts/Processes
- Realistic-message script: “Hardest year 1, 50+ hrs/week for ~$50k; path to $250k+ by year 5 if you master the system.”
- Referral program: bonuses for referrals regardless of hire; structured follow-up.
- Candidate assessment: grit/coachability behavioral interviews; DISC/PI/Caliper for drive/influence/resilience; red-flag filters.

## Action Plan
- Launch realistic messaging across job boards/social; target “unhappy pros” and veterans; formal referral rewards.
- Implement multi-stage screening + behavioral assessments; track funnel metrics weekly.
- Budget for higher CPH to attract quality; offer training allowance/forgivable draw for top candidates.
