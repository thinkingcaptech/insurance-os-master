# Training & Development

## Summary
- Training is continuous: foundational bootcamp (80% process, 20% product) plus ongoing role-play and advanced tracks.
- Role-play is mandatory leading indicator; advanced paths retain top producers (certifications, masterminds).

## Key Benchmarks
- Daily huddles (15 min); weekly team training (60 min); monthly advanced workshops (2 hr).
- Role-play required for <90-day agents (daily) and weekly for teams.

## Compliance Notes
- Include AML, BI, TCPA, privacy in curriculum; record completions in LMS.
- FINRA/variable content pre-reviewed; avoid promissory claims in training materials.

## Scripts/Processes
- Bootcamp: prospecting, CRM use, presentation, objections; product basics by line (FE/MP/ACA/IUL).
- Role-play scorecards; call QA feedback loops; upload best-call library to LMS.
- Advanced track: designations (CLU/ChFC), masterminds, case reviews for complex/high-net-worth.

## Action Plan
- Build LMS paths for new vs. veteran; set recurring huddles/trainings with agendas.
- Enforce role-play schedule; use AI/QA tools for call analysis where allowed.
- Offer advanced training incentives/recognition; tie completion to career path and comp tiers.
