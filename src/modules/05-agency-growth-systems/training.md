# Playbook: Training & Development

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

Onboarding (the first 30 days) is a one-time event. Training is a **continuous process**. This system is designed to create a culture of permanent, daily improvement.

The focus shifts from *learning the script* to *mastering the craft*. This is achieved through high-repetition role-play, live call analysis, and structured leadership development.

## 2.0 Core Training Systems

### 1. Daily Role-Play & Calibration (Non-Negotiable)

* **What:** A mandatory 1-hour "all-hands" group call every morning.
* **Why:** To calibrate mindset, review wins, and practice scripts *before* the day begins.
* **Format:**
    * **10 min:** Wins & Recognition (Leader shares wins from yesterday).
    * **10 min:** Mindset & Focus (Leader sets the "theme" for the day, e.g., "focus on isolating price").
    * **40 min:** Group Role-Play (Breakout rooms of 2-3 agents to drill one specific script, e.g., the "I can't afford it" objection).

### 2. Live Call Coaching (QA)

* **What:** The process of managers using the dialer's "Listen/Whisper/Barge" feature to coach agents *during* live calls.
* **SOP:**
    * **New Agents (<90 Days):** 1 hour of live listening *per week*.
    * **Veteran Agents:** 1 hour *per month*.
* **LMS Call Library:** Managers must save 1 "gold standard" and 1 "coachable moment" call per week and upload them to the **LMS Call Library** for all agents to review.

### 3. Leadership Development Pathway

* **What:** A structured path for high-producing agents to become team leaders.
* **SOP:**
    * **Tier 1 (Senior Agent):** Top 20% producer, >90% persistency.
    * **Tier 2 (Team Leader):** Responsible for running daily role-play and QA for 3-5 new agents. Receives a small override.
    * **Tier 3 (Agency Leader):** Responsible for recruiting, training, and managing a full team. Receives a full override (defined in Compensation).
* **LMS Course:** Agents must be certified on the "Leadership Development" course in the LMS (covering difficult conversations, KPI management, etc.) before advancing.
