# Pillar: HIPAA & Data Privacy

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

As a life and health agency, you are a "Covered Entity" (or a "Business Associate" of one) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This is not optional.

Any information that can identify a client in relation to their health status, applications, or policy information is **Protected Health Information (PHI)**. This includes names, dates, policy numbers, and any health-related data collected during underwriting.

A data breach or improper handling of PHI leads to severe fines and a complete loss of client and carrier trust. The entire technology stack must be "HIPAA-compliant" by default.

## 2.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

| Requirement | Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. HIPAA-Compliant Storage** | **SOP:** All client-facing documents (applications, needs analyses, consent forms) and all call/meeting recordings **must** be stored on HIPAA-compliant platforms. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** This means using a HIPAA-compliant CRM, cloud storage (e.g., Google Workspace w/ BAA), and recording solution. You **must** have a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with every technology vendor that "touches" PHI. |
| **2. Secure Communications** | **SOP:** PHI **must not** be sent over non-secure channels. &lt;br&gt; **Prohibited:** Sending applications, underwriting notes, or client lists via standard email, text message, or non-secure messaging apps (e.g., standard WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger). &lt;br&gt; **Mandatory:** Use secure, encrypted email portals, a HIPAA-compliant CRM portal, or secure fax to transmit PHI. |
| **3. Access & Device Control** | **SOP:** All agents and staff must use secure, unique passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all systems. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** All devices (laptops, phones) used to access PHI must be password-protected and have remote-wipe capability enabled in case of loss or theft. |
| **4. "Need to Know" Principle** | **SOP:** Agents and staff should only have access to the minimum PHI necessary to perform their jobs. &lt;Access to the full database should be restricted to compliance officers and senior leadership. |
| **5. Data Destruction** | **SOP:** When a client relationship is terminated (and after the 10-year CMS retention period), their data must be securely and permanently destroyed, not just deleted. |
