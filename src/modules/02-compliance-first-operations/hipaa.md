# HIPAA

## Summary
- PHI must be protected in transit and at rest; HIPAA applies to health-related interactions and stored recordings containing PHI.
- BAAs required with vendors handling PHI (e-sign, texting, storage).

## Key Benchmarks
- Retention: align with CMS/ACA 10-year recording where PHI present.
- Access control: least privilege; audit logs for PHI systems.

## Compliance Notes
- Use HIPAA-compliant tools (DocuSign/SignNow with BAA; compliant texting portals); avoid personal phone SMS for PHI.
- Secure channels for PHI (portal vs. email); encrypt where feasible; train staff on PHI handling.

## Scripts/Processes
- Consent notice when recording/discussing health info; store recordings securely.
- PHI handling SOP: collect only necessary data; log access; restrict sharing.
- Vendor review for HIPAA alignment and BAA execution.

## Action Plan
- Inventory PHI flows; ensure BAAs with all PHI-handling vendors.
- Enforce secure storage and access controls for recordings/docs; disable PHI in non-compliant channels.
- Train staff on HIPAA basics, breach reporting, and secure communication; test controls annually.
