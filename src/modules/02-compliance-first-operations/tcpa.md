# TCPA

## Summary
- One-to-one consent (Jan 27, 2025) invalidates aggregator/shared lead consents; agency must be named.
- Reasonable-manner opt-out (Apr 11, 2025): honor any-channel opt-out within 10 business days.
- Vicarious liability (Hossfeld): liable for vendor/sub-vendor violations.

## Key Benchmarks
- Penalties: $500–$1,500 per call/text; TSR up to ~$53k/violation.
- Scrubbing: National and state DNC every 31 days; internal DNC real-time.
- Time-of-day: 8a–9p recipient time zone.

## Compliance Notes
- Store consent proof (disclosure, timestamp, IP, named seller) 4+ years.
- Central Internal DNC synced to dialer/SMS/CRM; STOP applied globally.
- Audit all lead vendors; avoid non-compliant aged/shared lists.

## Scripts/Processes
- Consent language on forms: clear, conspicuous, agency-named; no pre-checked boxes.
- Opt-out logging SOP: capture from text/email/VM/phone; immediate update to internal DNC.
- Dialer settings: time-zone filters, DNC scrubbing, recording; local presence OK with transparency.

## Action Plan
- Audit/terminate aggregator contracts; update all web forms with agency-named consent.
- Deploy centralized DNC/consent store; integrate with dialer/SMS.
- Train all staff on opt-out handling; monitor compliance logs and vendor due diligence files.
