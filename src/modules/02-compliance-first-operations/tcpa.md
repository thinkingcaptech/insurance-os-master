# Pillar: TCPA (Calling & Texting)

## 1.0 The Strategic Mandate: The End of "Buy-and-Dial"

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) is the single greatest legal threat to an insurance agency in 2025. The "lead generator loophole" is closed.

Any agency operating on a model of buying shared, non-exclusive leads and using aggressive dialing is exposed to agency-ending fines of **$500 to $1,500 *per violation* (per call/text)**.

This OS mandates a pivot to a "Compliance-First" model built on proprietary, verifiably-consented leads.

## 2.0 The Core Rule: FCC "One-to-One Consent"

This is the new law of the land, effective January 27, 2025.

* **What it is:** A consumer's consent must be given to **one specific seller (your agency)** at a time. The consent must be "clear and conspicuous".
* **What it Kills:** The lead generator model where a consumer fills out one form and "agrees to be contacted by our marketing partners," which links to a list of dozens or hundreds of companies.
* **The Ticking Time Bomb:** After this date, any agency buying shared leads from a vendor who cannot provide a date-stamped, consumer-facing record (e.g., a screenshot and IP address) of that consumer *specifically selecting your agency by name* is willfully non-compliant and exposed to massive liability.

## 3.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

| Requirement | Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Prior Express Written Consent** | **Do NOT call or text any lead** (purchased or generated) without definitive proof of one-to-one consent. This proof (timestamp, IP, screenshot of the form) must be stored in the CRM, attached to the lead record. |
| **2. National DNC Registry** | All lead lists (purchased or generated) **must** be scrubbed against the National Do Not Call (DNC) registry at least every 31 days. An "existing business relationship" or one-to-one consent is the only safe harbor. |
| **3. Compliant SMS (Texting)** | SMS is the highest-risk channel. Every first text must: &lt;br&gt; 1. Clearly identify the agent and agency name. &lt;br&gt; 2. Include a clear and immediate opt-out mechanism (e.g., "Reply STOP to unsubscribe"). |
| **4. Honoring Opt-Outs** | All opt-out requests (including replies like "STOP," "No," "Unsubscribe") must be honored **immediately** and globally across all systems (dialer, CRM, marketing automation). This requires a centralized, compliant tech stack. |
| **5. Time-of-Day Restrictions** | All manual and automated contact (calls, texts) is strictly prohibited before **8:00 a.m.** or after **9:00 p.m.** *in the lead's local time zone*. |
| **6. Vicarious Liability** | The agency is legally liable for the violations of its 1099 independent contractor agents. **The "independent contractor" defense is not a shield.** This mandates that all agents use the agency-provided, compliant tech stack (CRM and Dialer) as a condition of their contract. |
