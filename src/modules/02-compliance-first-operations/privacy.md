# Pillar: State Privacy Laws (CCPA/CPRA)

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

A growing patchwork of state-level data privacy laws, led by the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**, creates new rules for handling Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

These laws grant consumers specific rights, including:
* **The Right to Know:** What PII is being collected, sold, or shared.
* **The Right to Delete:** The right to request the deletion of their PII.
* **The Right to Opt-Out:** The right to direct a business *not* to sell or share their PII.

This primarily impacts **lead generation** and **marketing automation**.

## 2.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

| Requirement | Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Update Privacy Policy** | **SOP:** The agency website **must** have a clear and conspicuous Privacy Policy. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** This policy must be updated to include the specific rights granted by laws like CCPA/CPRA, including a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link and a clear description of the data you collect (e.g., from lead forms) and why. |
| **2. Honor Deletion Requests** | **SOP:** The agency **must** have a documented, verifiable process for honoring a consumer's "Right to Delete" request. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** This process must be completed within the law's required timeframe (e.g., 45 days) and must be logged in a compliance tracker. *Note: This right may be superseded by the 10-year CMS/HIPAA retention mandates*. |
| **3. Honor Opt-Out Requests** | **SOP:** The "Do Not Sell or Share" link on the website must lead to a functional form. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** When a request is received, the consumer's PII (e.g., lead data) must be immediately flagged in the CRM and excluded from all future sales, sharing, or marketing lists. |
| **4. Data Minimization** | **SOP:** Only collect the PII that is absolutely necessary. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** Audit all lead generation forms. Do not ask for sensitive information (like SSN or detailed health info) on an initial, unsecured web form. Collect this data securely *after* consent is established. |
