# Privacy & Data Security

## Summary
- States adopting NAIC Data Security Model #668; GLBA safeguards apply; HIPAA when handling PHI.
- Mandatory information security program, vendor oversight, incident response, and access controls.

## Key Benchmarks
- Risk assessments: periodic documented reviews.
- Breach notification: state timelines vary; must have documented plan.
- Access controls: least privilege; audit logs for sensitive systems.

## Compliance Notes
- Written ISP with encryption where feasible, MFA, backups, and monitoring.
- Vendor DPAs/BAAs for data processors (e-sign, texting, storage); verify security posture.
- Secure document management; prefer portals over email for sensitive data.

## Scripts/Processes
- Data handling SOP: classify data, restrict PHI access, encrypt at rest/in transit where feasible.
- Vendor onboarding checklist: security questionnaire, BAA/DPA, breach history, data retention limits.
- Incident response: detect → contain → notify → document; maintain contact tree and templates.

## Action Plan
- Implement NAIC #668-aligned ISP; document roles, controls, and testing cadence.
- Audit current vendors for DPAs/BAAs; replace non-compliant services.
- Train staff on data handling, phishing awareness, and breach response; enforce MFA and logging.
