# CMS / Medicare & ACA

## Summary
- All marketing/sales/enrollment calls and virtual meetings for MA/PDP and ACA must be recorded and stored 10 years.
- CMS cracking down on misleading plan names and ads; strict disclaimers and prohibitions on unsolicited MA D2D.

## Key Benchmarks
- Recording retention: 10 years for MA/PDP and ACA interactions.
- OEP: Jan 1 effective deadline Dec 7 (MA/PDP); ACA OEP Nov 1–Jan 15 (Dec 15 for Jan 1 effective).

## Compliance Notes
- No unsolicited D2D for MA/PDP; do not pivot from FE knock to MA discussion.
- Use CMS-approved disclaimers and accurate plan naming; avoid “HSA” misuse.
- HIPAA handling of PHI; secure storage/access controls for recordings.

## Scripts/Processes
- Opening script: disclose recording and purpose; confirm consent to proceed.
- Verification of scope of appointment (SOA) where required; store signed SOA and recordings together.
- Post-call summary stored in CRM with recording link and consent documentation.

## Action Plan
- Enable universal call/virtual recording; archive for 10 years with access controls.
- Standardize CMS-compliant scripts/disclaimers; train on SOA and no unsolicited MA D2D rules.
- Periodic audits of recordings/ads for compliance; correct plan naming and disclosures.
