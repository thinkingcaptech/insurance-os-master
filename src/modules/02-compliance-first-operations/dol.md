# Pillar: DOL Fiduciary Rule

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

The Department of Labor (DOL) Fiduciary Rule, specifically its "Retirement Security Rule," expands the "investment advice fiduciary" definition under ERISA.

This rule primarily impacts agents selling **Annuities** (especially Fixed Indexed Annuities) and IUL when the sale involves a **rollover from a qualified retirement plan** (e.g., a 401(k) or IRA).

**The Core Rule:** If an agent gives advice on a 401(k)-to-IRA or IRA-to-Annuity rollover, they are acting as a **fiduciary**. This means they **must** act in the client's best interest and cannot receive compensation (commissions) that creates a conflict of interest, *unless* they use a specific "Prohibited Transaction Exemption" (PTE).

## 2.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

| Requirement | Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Use Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE 84-24)** | **SOP:** To receive a commission for a rollover-funded annuity, the agency **must** comply with all requirements of **PTE 84-24**. &lt;br&gt; **This includes:** &lt;br&gt; 1. Providing written disclosures to the client that the agent is a fiduciary. &lt;br&gt; 2. Documenting *why* the rollover is in the client's best interest. &lt;br&gt; 3. Disclosing all compensation and conflicts of interest. &lt;br&gt; 4. Ensuring the compensation (commission) is "reasonable." |
| **2. Document Rollover Justification** | **SOP:** A "Rollover Justification Form" **must** be completed and e-signed for **every** transaction funded by a 401(k) or IRA. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** This form must compare the costs, risks, and services of the old plan (the 401(k)) versus the new product (the annuity) and provide a detailed written explanation for why the move is in the client's best interest. |
| **3. Prohibit Unqualified Advice** | **SOP:** Agents who are not properly licensed (e.g., IAR) or who are not fully trained on PTE 84-24 are **prohibited** from recommending rollovers. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** All rollover-related marketing and sales scripts must be pre-approved by the agency's compliance officer. |
