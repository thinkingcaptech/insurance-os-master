# DOL Fiduciary

## Summary
- 2024 DOL rule makes rollover advice fiduciary; commissions become prohibited transactions without PTE.
- Direct conflict with NAIC BI disclosures (non-fiduciary); must follow stricter DOL standard when rollovers involved.

## Key Benchmarks
- Trigger: advice to move employer plan/IRA assets.
- Compliance path: PTE 2020-02 or 84-24; written fiduciary acknowledgment; conflict mitigation.

## Compliance Notes
- Provide fiduciary acknowledgment for rollover advice; disclose compensation/conflicts; document prudent process.
- Maintain both DOL (fiduciary) and NAIC BI paperwork in client file for rollover-funded annuities/IUL.
- Train agents on when rollover triggers apply; supervise for adherence.

## Scripts/Processes
- Intake: flag “Retirement Asset” to trigger dual workflow.
- Provide written fiduciary disclosure + compensation/conflict details; deliver BI forms for product recommendation.
- Retain rationale for rollover vs. stay-in-plan; compare costs/benefits in writing.

## Action Plan
- Adopt PTE 2020-02/84-24 procedures; update disclosures and templates.
- Train agents on dual-standard workflow; supervise rollover cases closely.
- Audit files for fiduciary acknowledgments and BI documentation; remediate gaps.
