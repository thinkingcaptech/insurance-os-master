# Compliance-First Operations

## Summary
- Regulatory convergence: TCPA one-to-one consent, FTC/TSR, DOL fiduciary, NAIC Best Interest/Data Security, CMS recording.
- Shift to provable, systemic compliance (consent/DNC logs, recordings, documentation, product-specific CE).
- Vicarious liability and aggregator lead risk make first-party consent and vetted vendors mandatory.

## Key Benchmarks
- TCPA fines: $500–$1,500 per call/text; FTC TSR up to ~$53k/violation.
- Recording: Medicare/ACA/MA-PDP calls/virtual meetings stored 10 years.
- CE: product-specific (e.g., CA annuity 8/4 hrs, LTC 8/8, 4-hr life policy, 2-hr variable life; FL/TX annuity/LTC updates).

## Compliance Notes
- One-to-one consent (Jan 27, 2025); reasonable-manner opt-out (Apr 11, 2025) with 10-day processing.
- DOL fiduciary for rollovers + NAIC BI for annuity sale; follow stricter (DOL) standard when both apply.
- Data security: NAIC #668/GLBA safeguards; HIPAA for PHI; BAA for e-sign/texting.

## Scripts/Processes
- Consent capture: explicit agency naming on web forms; store disclosure, timestamp, IP.
- Internal DNC workflow: capture STOP/opt-out from any channel; immediate propagation to dialer/CRM/SMS.
- Dual-standard workflow for rollovers: fiduciary acknowledgement + PTE steps + BI documentation.

## Action Plan
- 0–90 days: Centralize consent/DNC; enforce time-of-day rules; enable universal recording; terminate aggregator leads; standardize BI/replacement packets.
- 6–12 months: Build CE/qualification tracking; implement NAIC #668-style security program; ad/content review process; compliant SMS/e-sign with BAA.
- 1–2 years: Embed compliance controls into CRM/AMS; periodic vendor audits; role-based training cadence; monitor persistency/complaints/replacements.
