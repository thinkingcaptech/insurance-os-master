# Pillar: NAIC (Suitability & Best Interest)

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

The NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners) "Best Interest" model regulation, and the SEC's Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), govern product recommendations, particularly for high-friction products like **Indexed Universal Life (IUL)** and **Annuities**.

These rules were created in direct response to misleading marketing. Failure to comply is the single greatest legal threat to an IUL-focused agency, leading to lawsuits, carrier termination, and license revocation.

The mandate is to shift from a "sales" process to a **defensible, documented "advice" process.**

## 2.0 The Core Rules: Four Obligations

The NAIC model requires agents to satisfy four key "obligations":

1.  **Care Obligation:** You must act with reasonable diligence, care, and skill to act in the consumer's best interest.
2.  **Disclosure Obligation:** You must clearly disclose your role as an agent and the nature of your compensation.
3.  **Conflict of Interest Obligation:** You must identify and mitigate or avoid conflicts of interest.
4.  **Documentation Obligation:** You **must** document in writing the specific justification for any recommendation, proving how it meets the client's stated needs and objectives.

## 3.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

| Requirement | Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Prohibit Misleading Phrases** | **SOP:** All agents are **prohibited** from using misleading "warning sign" phrases when marketing IUL. This is a zero-tolerance policy. &lt;br&gt; **Prohibited:** "Tax-free retirement plan," "401(k) alternative," "No downside market risk," "The policy will pay for itself". |
| **2. Mandate Compliant Language** | **SOP:** Agents **must** use balanced, accurate language. &lt;br&gt; **Mandatory:** Use "tax-deferred growth," "tax-free policy *loans*," and "a 0% *floor*," and always disclose that policy costs, fees, and cap rates apply. |
| **3. Mandate Suitability Checks** | **SOP:** Implement the **"3-4 Year Cash Value Reality Check"** as a mandatory part of the IUL sales process. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** Proactively explain that meaningful cash surrender value will likely not be available for 3-4 years. This ethically disqualifies bad-fit clients and builds trust. |
| **4. Document Justification** | **SOP:** A "Suitability & Best Interest" form **must** be completed and e-signed by the client for every IUL/Annuity application. &lt;br&gt; **Action:** This form must document the client's financial goals, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs, with a written justification from the agent explaining how the chosen product aligns with those objectives. This is the primary defense in an audit. |
