# NAIC & State Standards

## Summary
- NAIC Best Interest (#275) adopted by all states for annuities; enhanced suitability with care, disclosure, conflict management, documentation.
- Replacement rules and senior protections strictly enforced; high exam focus.
- NAIC Data Security (#668) driving state privacy/security mandates.

## Key Benchmarks
- Documentation: signed consumer profile, disclosures, “why” rationale retained.
- Replacements: carrier/agent forms; disclose surrender charges, costs, lost benefits.
- Senior protections: avoid misleading designations; follow unfair trade practices acts.

## Compliance Notes
- BI is not fiduciary; conflicts allowed if disclosed/managed; but must pair with DOL fiduciary when rollovers involved.
- Track state-specific CE (e.g., CA annuity BI 8/4 hr, LTC, life policy, variable life).
- Data security obligations under #668: ISP, vendor oversight, incident response.

## Scripts/Processes
- BI workflow: gather full profile; present suitable options; disclose role/comp/conflicts; document recommendation rationale; obtain signatures.
- Replacement checklist: compare old/new, document surrender charges and lost benefits; client acknowledgement.
- Senior interactions: plain-language disclosures; avoid pressure; document understanding.

## Action Plan
- Implement BI and replacement packets/templates; mandate file documentation.
- Track and enforce product-specific CE; audit files for BI completeness.
- Align security program with NAIC #668 requirements; update vendor contracts accordingly.
