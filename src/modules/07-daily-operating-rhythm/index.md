# Module 7: Daily Operating Rhythm

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

This module translates the **KPIs (Module 6)** into a non-negotiable **daily schedule**. An agent's success is not determined by "working hard" but by executing a predictable series of "blocks" consistently.

This system is the primary defense against "Agent Drift". It provides a clear, repeatable, and manageable template for an agent's day. The goal is to create a rhythm where the *process* is the boss, not the agent's motivation.

This rhythm is the framework that all daily training, coaching, and accountability is built upon.

## 2.0 Core Rhythm Components

* **[The Daily Rhythm (Block Schedule)](daily-rhythm/):** The master "block schedule" for a full-time agent, balancing calibration, prospecting, and follow-up.
* **[The Weekly Accountability Rhythm](weekly-rhythm/):** The weekly check-in and planning process to review KPIs and set targets.
* **[The "Setter/Closer" Model](setter-closer/):** An advanced model for scaling teams by bifurcating the sales role into two specialties: appointment setting and closing.
