# Lead Generation Playbook

## Summary
- Proprietary, education-first funnels plus compliance-first tech stacks outperform vendor-dependent buys.
- Speed-to-lead and one-to-one consent are decisive for FE/MP/ACA; education and expectation-setting drive IUL.
- Partner/referral ecosystems (REA/LO, COI) and database intent signals yield the strongest CPA/LTV.

## Key Benchmarks
- FE: Meta self-gen $9–$40 CPL; 2–8% close if <5 min; direct mail 3–5% response; referrals 30–60%.
- MP: REA/LO referrals 15–25% close; self-gen intent 30–60%; aged MP leads ~1% close.
- ACA: Paid CPL ~$42–$54; ~11% conversion; OEP subsidy-expiration spikes demand.
- IUL/Whole: Purchased 2–3% vs. self-gen 5–10%; long cycle; webinars/COI improve trust.

## Compliance Notes
- TCPA one-to-one consent (Jan 27, 2025); avoid shared/aggregator leads without explicit agency naming.
- HEC ad targeting limits (FB/Google); rely on creative-as-targeting and required disclosures.
- ACA/Medicare: 10-year call/virtual recording; HIPAA handling of PHI; STOP/opt-out immediately honored.

## Scripts/Processes
- Speed-to-lead play: <5 min call on digital inbound; multi-touch SMS/email with explicit consent language.
- Partner play: REA/LO referral intake and follow-up; COI/referral scripts for FE/IUL.
- Nurture play: IUL/Whole educational drip (myths → indexed growth → tax treatment → case study).
- Direct mail + door-knock follow-up for FE/aged; policy-review pivots for MP replacements.

## Action Plan
- 0–90 days: Standardize consent forms and disclosures; enable recording/DNC scrubbing; launch FE Meta + mail + referrals; start MP partner outreach + intent-signal setup; build ACA OEP/SEP pages/scripts.
- 6–12 months: Implement always-on nurture; upload offline conversions (MP funded loans); formalize COI programs; track CPA/persistency dashboards.
- 1–2 years: Scale proprietary funnels; phase out high-risk aged/shared leads; expand partner ecosystems; continuous compliance audits.
