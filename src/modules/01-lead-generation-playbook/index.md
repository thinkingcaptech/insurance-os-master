# Module 1: Lead Generation Playbook

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

The 2024-2025 landscape represents a non-negotiable inflection point for insurance distribution. The legacy "buy-and-dial" model is being systematically legislated out of existence.

Success in this new era is defined by two competencies:

1.  **Proprietary Funnels:** Mastering the creation of exclusive, consent-verified leads through digital funnels, educational content, and partnerships. The agency's greatest asset is now its proprietary database.
2.  **Compliance-First Technology:** Adopting a tech stack that can *prove* consent and manage opt-outs flawlessly. Any lead acquired from a vendor after January 27, 2025, must be accompanied by evidence that the consumer affirmatively selected the agency *by name*.

This module provides the playbooks for building and managing these proprietary lead funnels.

## 2.0 Core Playbooks

This module is broken down by product line, as each requires a distinct economic, compliance, and operational approach.

* **[Final Expense (FE)](fe/):** The high-velocity cash flow engine. The strategy balances Meta ads and direct mail with a ruthless "speed-to-lead" operation.
* **[Mortgage Protection (MP)](mp/):** The relationship-driven model. With trigger leads being eliminated, the pivot to Realtor/Loan Officer partnerships and self-generated "intent signals" is a survival mandate.
* **[ACA Health Plans](aca/):** The high-volume, high-compliance annuity. This is a low-margin, operationally-intensive model where profit is found in renewal persistency and absolute adherence to CMS 10-year recording rules.
* **[Indexed Universal Life (IUL)](iul/):** The education-first, high-LTV model. This is a long-cycle nurture game built on webinars, LinkedIn, and COI (Centers of Influence) partnerships, with a mandatory "3-4 year cash value reality check" to ensure compliance and client fit.

## 3.0 Foundational Systems

The playbooks above are supported by the core infrastructure:

* **CRM & Workflow Automation:** The central nervous system for managing leads, automating follow-up, and tracking KPIs.
* **Lead Recycling:** A systematic process for monetizing aged or unresponsive leads thr
