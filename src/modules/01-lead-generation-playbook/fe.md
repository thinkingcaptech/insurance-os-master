# Final Expense

## Summary
- Seniors respond to simple, trust-based offers; direct mail + door-knock follow-up and Meta creative-as-targeting remain effective.
- Referrals/COI are highest quality; aged leads are purely dialer fuel with heavy automation.
- Speed-to-lead (<5 min) determines digital close rates.

## Key Benchmarks
- Meta self-gen: $9–$40 CPL; 2–8% close if contacted <5 min.
- Direct mail: ~$30–$60 per responder; 3–5% response; letters outperform postcards.
- Aged leads: $0.30–$3.50; <1–3% close; live transfers $40–$100+ with 5–15% close.
- Referrals/COI: $0 CPL; 30–60% close.

## Compliance Notes
- TCPA one-to-one consent; DNC scrubbing; record calls; STOP honored immediately.
- HEC ad rules on Meta; avoid demographic targeting; include clear disclosures.
- Door-knock OK for FE; don’t cross-sell MA/PDP unsolicited.

## Scripts/Processes
- Digital lead: “Hi [Name], I’m calling you back about the burial coverage info you requested—takes 5 minutes.”
- Mail follow-up D2D: “I’m just following up on the card you returned about state-regulated final expense—porch or kitchen is fine; 10 minutes.”
- Referral ask: after delivery, request 2–3 COI/community contacts; log and follow with thank-you touch.

## Action Plan
- Launch Meta FE campaign with senior-friendly creative and fast routing; pair with direct mail in key ZIPs.
- Stand up compliant dialer + cadences for aged/live transfer handling; <5 min SLA on fresh.
- Formalize referral/COI program (scripts, CRM tracking, reminders); door-knock playbook for unresponsive responders.
