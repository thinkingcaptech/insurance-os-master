# Playbook: Final Expense (FE) Lead Generation

## 1.0 Economic Model & Strategy

* **Economic Model:** Final Expense is the agency's high-velocity, transactional cash flow engine. It is characterized by high, advanced first-year commissions (FYC) of 80-120% offset by significant chargeback risk (100% clawback on 6-9 month advances) and high lapse rates (20-30%).
* **Core Strategy:** The strategy is built on lead volume and "speed-to-lead." Conversion is almost entirely dependent on contacting the lead within the first 5 minutes. This is a high-activity, compliance-first dialing operation.

## 2.0 Lead Source Benchmarks

| Lead Source | Avg. Cost (CPL) | Avg. Conversion | Compliance Risk | Key Tactic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Facebook (Self-Gen)** | $9 - $40 | 2% - 8% (if &lt; 5 min) | **High (TCPA/HEC)** | "Creative-as-Targeting" due to HEC ad limits. Speed-to-lead is mandatory. |
| **Direct Mail** | $30 - $60 (per response) | 3% - 5% (response) | **Low** | Targets seniors effectively. Slower cycle. Best used as a feed for a targeted door-knocking/follow-up day. |
| **Aged Leads** | $0.30 - $3.50 | &lt;1% - 3% | **Very High (TCPA)** | "Dialer fuel" only. Requires a compliant, high-efficiency dialer and automation. Unprofitable without a system. |
| **Live Transfers** | $40 - $100+ | 5% - 15% | **Medium (Vendor)** | Bypasses the speed-to-lead problem. Ideal for skilled closers, but vendor compliance (consent) must be verified. |
| **Referrals / COI** | $0 | 30% - 60% | **Very Low** | Highest quality. Must be systemized via formal partnerships with senior centers, community leaders, and existing clients. |

## 3.0 Operational Mandates

1.  **Speed-to-Lead (The 1-5-1 Rule):**
    * **1 Minute:** An automated Text (SMS) and Email must be sent to the lead within 60 seconds to "stop the clock" and establish contact.
    * **5 Minutes:** The agent must perform the first manual dial within 5 minutes. The likelihood of reaching a lead drops 10x after this window.
    * **1 Call (Minimum):** The agent's goal is a one-call close, moving from introduction to application in a single, 20-45 minute conversation.

2.  **Compliance-First Dialing:**
    * **TCPA:** All leads must have documented "one-to-one" prior express written consent. This means the lead *explicitly* consented to be contacted by *your agency by name*.
    * **HEC:** Facebook ad targeting is restricted. You cannot target by age, gender, or financial status. All targeting must be done via the ad creative and copy (e.g., "Attention Seniors on a Fixed Income").
    * **Dialing:** All dialing must be done through a compliant, agency-approved dialer that respects DNC lists and time-of-day regulations (8 a.m. - 9 p.m. local time).
