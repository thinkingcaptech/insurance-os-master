# Playbook: Mortgage Protection (MP) Lead Generation

## 1.0 Economic Model & Strategic Mandate

* **Economic Model:** Mortgage Protection (Term Life) is a high-cashflow, high-persistency product. It combines a high FYC (up to 145%) with very high 13-month persistency (85%–97%), minimizing the chargeback risk common in FE.
* **Strategic Mandate: The Great Pivot:** The entire Mortgage Protection industry is built on credit-pull "trigger leads," which will be **banned** by the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 2808). Survival in this market is 100% dependent on pivoting to a new, non-trigger-based model **before March 5, 2026**.

## 2.0 The New Model: Partnerships & Intent Signals

The post-trigger-ban model is a proactive, relationship-based system, not a reactive data-buying one.

| Lead Source | Avg. Cost (CPL) | Avg. Conversion | Compliance Risk | Key Tactic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Partner Referrals (Realtor/LO)** | $0 | **15% - 25%** | **Very Low** | **(The New Primary)**. This is a survival-critical pivot. Build systematized referral partnerships with Loan Officers & Real Estate Agents. Provide value first (e.g., rapid quotes) to become their trusted, exclusive insurance partner. |
| **Self-Gen "Intent Signals"** | $0 (Database) | **30% - 60%** | **Low** | Nurture your existing database with value (e.g., home equity reports). Monitor for "intent signals" like a client running an equity check or browsing listings on your co-branded portal. This allows you to spot intent *before* the loan application. |
| **Fresh Digital Leads (Self-Gen)** | $20 - $100+ | Low (1-3%) | **High (TCPA/HEC)** | Uses HEC "Special Ads Category" rules. Must optimize for **CPA per Funded Loan**, not CPL. Track offline conversions back to the ad platform to train the algorithm. |
| **Aged Leads** | $2 - $12 | ~1% | **Very High (TCPA)** | Low-cost dialer fuel, but carries extreme TCPA risk. Requires rigorous list scrubbing and a compliant dialer. |

## 3.0 Operational Mandates

1.  **Launch B2B Partnership Funnel (NOW):** This is not an optional task; it is the new business model.
    * **Action:** Formally launch your partnership outreach program.
    * **Tactic:** Offer co-marketing and rapid-quoting services to Loan Officers to help them close loans faster. This makes you a valuable asset, not a vendor.
    * **Scripting:** Position your product as superior to the lender's MPI. Your plan has a **level benefit** that goes **directly to the family**, unlike the lender's **decreasing benefit** that only **pays the bank**.

2.  **HEC & FCRA Compliance:**
    * **HEC (Housing, Employment, Credit):** All digital ads fall under Meta's "Special Ads Category." You cannot target by age, gender, or ZIP code.
    * **FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act):** This is the act being amended to ban trigger leads. All agency operations must be fully compliant with FCRA data handling rules.
