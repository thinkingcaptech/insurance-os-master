# Mortgage Protection

## Summary
- Trigger leads are ending; pivot to REA/LO partnerships and self-generated intent signals.
- Focus on CPA per funded loan, not cheap CPL; warm referrals materially outperform aged/shared lists.

## Key Benchmarks
- REA/LO referrals: 15–25% close.
- Self-gen intent/database nurture: 30–60% close.
- Fresh digital leads: $20–$100+ CPL; low single-digit close unless optimized.
- Aged MP leads: $2–$12 CPL; ~1% close.

## Compliance Notes
- TCPA one-to-one consent; aggregator/aged lists are high-liability post-Jan 27, 2025.
- HEC ad restrictions (Meta/Google); accurate disclosures; DNC/time-of-day enforcement.
- Replacements: follow state replacement rules; avoid twisting.

## Scripts/Processes
- Partner intake: “I’m your in-house insurance resource—15 minutes to protect the payment; which day works?”
- Intent signals: monitor equity checks/listing views/refi calculators; rapid outreach with payment-protection framing.
- Policy review pivot for existing coverage: confirm term expiry vs. mortgage duration.

## Action Plan
- Build 3–5 REA/LO partnerships; co-branded content + fast-quote workflows.
- Stand up database intent tracking; trigger cadences for move/refi signals.
- Optimize ads to “scheduled appointment” and upload funded-loan conversions; enforce consent logging and DNC controls.
