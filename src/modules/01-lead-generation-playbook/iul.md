# IUL / Whole Life

## Summary
- Education-first, long-cycle sales; trust built via webinars, guides, and COI credibility.
- Critical to set the “3–4 year cash value reality” to filter for long-term fits.

## Key Benchmarks
- Purchased life leads: 2–3% close.
- Self-gen/nurtured: 5–10% close; higher with COI/HNW referrals.
- Sales cycle often 30–90+ days; nurture 6–12 months.

## Compliance Notes
- Avoid promissory/guaranteed claims; accurate illustration and expectation setting.
- Suitability/Best Interest disclosures; document rationale; FINRA rules if variable.
- Record calls/meetings when health/Medicare discussed; protect PHI.

## Scripts/Processes
- Webinar funnel: 90% education on tax-free retirement/market volatility; CTA to strategy call.
- COI referral: CPAs/attorneys/tax advisors; provide cases and co-branded education.
- Drip sequence: myths → indexed growth → downside protection → tax treatment → case study → CTA.

## Action Plan
- Launch monthly webinars and downloadable guides; capture explicit consent and book consultations.
- Build COI network; LinkedIn Sales Navigator for targeted outreach; nurture HNW via case studies.
- Standardize expectation-setting slide on 3–4 year cash value access; document suitability in CRM.
