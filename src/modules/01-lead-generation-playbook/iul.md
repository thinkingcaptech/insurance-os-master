# Playbook: IUL & Whole Life Lead Generation

## 1.0 Economic Model & Strategy

* **Economic Model:** IUL is a high-margin, high-friction, long-cycle product. It has the highest average premium (Avg. AP ~$5,800) but is plagued by **severe, multi-year chargeback liability** (e.g., 100% Y1, 90% Y2, 80% Y3) and a **low placement ratio** (50-70%) due to full underwriting.
* **Core Strategy:** You do not "sell" IUL; you "teach" it. The entire funnel is built on **education-first, conceptual marketing** to build trust and attract qualified, long-term clients. The sales cycle is long (30-90+ days), and success depends on long-term automated nurturing.

## 2.0 Lead Source Benchmarks

| Lead Source | Avg. Cost (CPL) | Avg. Conversion | Compliance Risk | Key Tactic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Webinars / Seminars** | Media/Time Cost | 5% - 10% (Self-Gen) | **High (NAIC)** | **(Primary Model)**. Run digital ads (LinkedIn/Meta) for a free educational webinar (e.g., "Tax-Free Retirement Strategies"). Offer a 1-on-1 consultation as the Call-to-Action. |
| **COI Referrals (CPA/Attorneys)** | $0 (Relationship) | 15% - 25%+ | **Low** | Build formal B2B partnerships with CPAs, estate planners, and tax advisors. These are the highest-quality warm referrals. |
| **LinkedIn (Self-Gen)** | $0 (Time Cost) | Varies | **Medium** | Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find ideal prospects (e.g., middle-income/mass affluent) and engage with educational content, not a sales pitch. |
| **Purchased Leads** | Varies | 2% - 3% | **Very High (TCPA/NAIC)** | Very low conversion. Only effective as part of a long-term (6-12 month), value-based automated email nurture sequence. |

## 3.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

This product has the highest risk of misrepresentation, which is the primary driver of lawsuits and regulatory (NAIC) action.

1.  **NAIC "Best Interest" Standard:**
    * **Action:** You **must** act in the consumer's best interest and **document** the justification for the recommendation.
    * **Prohibited Phrases:** Train all agents to **NEVER** use misleading phrases like:
        * "Tax-free retirement plan"
        * "A 401(k) / Roth IRA alternative"
        * "No downside market risk!"
        * "The policy will pay for itself".
    * **Compliant Truth:** The pitch must be balanced. Use "tax-deferred growth," "tax-free policy *loans*," and "a 0% *floor*," and explain that policy costs and fees are still deducted.

2.  **The "3-4 Year Cash Value Reality Check":**
    * **Action:** To build trust and ensure suitability, you must proactively educate prospects on the "3-4 year cash value reality check."
    * **Tactic:** Explain that meaningful cash surrender value (the portion accessible for loans) will likely **not be available for the first 3-4 years**. This disqualifies bad-fit clients seeking short-term liquidity and builds immense trust with the correct, long-term-focused clients.

3.  **Long-Term Nurture Automation:**
    * **Action:** Implement a 6-12 month, value-based automated email sequence for all IUL leads.
    * **Content:** The sequence should be 90% education (market myths, tax treatment, case studies) and 10% call-to-action ("Book a 15-min illustration call").
