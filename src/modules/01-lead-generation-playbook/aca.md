# Playbook: ACA Health Plan Lead Generation

## 1.0 Economic Model & Strategy

* **Economic Model:** ACA is a low-margin, high-volume, high-compliance annuity model. Revenue is generated via a "Per Member Per Month" (PMPM) fee, typically $18-$27. It is an "as-earned" model, which eliminates the chargeback risk of FE/IUL but requires operational excellence to manage.
* **Core Strategy:** The strategy is purely transactional and compliance-driven. Profit is not found in the initial sale but in **long-term persistency** (renewals) and **absolute avoidance of fines**. The entire operational model must be built around the non-negotiable CMS compliance mandates.

## 2.0 Lead Source & Market Drivers

| Lead Source | Avg. Cost (CPL) | Avg. Conversion | Compliance Risk | Key Tactic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Paid Leads** | $42 - $54 | ~11% | **Extreme (CMS/TCPA)** | Low conversion means this is only profitable at scale with a flawless, compliant tech stack. |
| **OEP Driver (Subsidy Expiration)** | $0 (Market Event) | High (Inbound) | **Extreme** | The enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. This will cause market-wide panic. Marketing should be focused on this event (e.g., "ACA Subsidies Expiring? Here Are Your Options") to capture this massive inbound, high-intent traffic. |
| **SEP Driver (QLEs)** | $0 (Market Event) | High (Inbound) | **Extreme** | "Always-on" digital marketing to capture Qualifying Life Events (QLEs) like job loss, divorce, moving, or (most significantly) the "unwinding" of Medicaid/CHIP. |
| **"Help On Demand"** | $0 | Varies | **Extreme** | Use the official Healthcare.gov "Help on Demand" system for free, high-intent inbound referrals. This is a primary source for new, compliant agents. |

## 3.0 Operational Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

This product line carries existential legal and regulatory risk. Failure in compliance will erase all margins and can end the agency.

1.  **CMS 10-Year Recording Mandate:**
    * **Action:** You **must** record and securely store **ALL** "sales, marketing, and enrollment calls" for a minimum of **10 years**.
    * **Scope:** This includes all phone calls and **all virtual meetings** (Zoom, Teams, etc.).
    * **The "Medicare Trap":** If an agent sells both ACA and Medicare, this rule is triggered by default. An unrecorded ACA call that pivots to a Medicare question ("What happens when I turn 65?") is an instant compliance violation.
    * **OS Solution:** Implement a 10-year, HIPAA-compliant recording solution for **all calls and meetings for all agents**.

2.  **CMS 10-Year Consent Mandate:**
    * **Action:** You **must** obtain and retain "Consent to Contact" documentation from every consumer for a minimum of **10 years**.
    * **Action:** You **must** obtain and retain the consumer's "Eligibility Attestation" (confirming their application info is correct) for **10 years**.

3.  **TCPA "One-to-One Consent":**
    * As with all leads, you must have proof that the consumer gave explicit, prior written consent to be contacted *by your agency, by name*.
