# ACA

## Summary
- Low-margin, high-volume, compliance-heavy; success hinges on deadlines (OEP) and QLE-driven SEP.
- Subsidy expiration (end of 2025) is the major OEP demand driver; SEP targets Medicaid unwinding, job loss, moves.

## Key Benchmarks
- Paid CPL: ~$42–$54; ~11% conversion.
- Help On Demand / referrals: $0 CPL, high intent.
- Cycle: OEP Nov 1–Jan 15; Dec 15 for Jan 1 effective.

## Compliance Notes
- 10-year consent-to-contact and 10-year recording (also MA if discussed).
- CMS ad naming rules; avoid misleading plan names; required disclaimers.
- TCPA/DNC for dialing/texting; HIPAA for PHI; honor STOP immediately.

## Scripts/Processes
- OEP message: “Subsidies expiring? Let’s review your options before Dec 15/Jan 15.”
- SEP triggers: Medicaid unwinding, job loss, move—quick screening > plan compare > app.
- Confirmation/reminder emails/texts with recorded-call notice; retain authorizations.

## Action Plan
- Build OEP landing + scripts around subsidy changes; prep staffing for Nov–Jan surge.
- Year-round SEP campaigns targeting QLEs; integrate Help On Demand for free referrals.
- Enforce universal recording/retention; standardize consent language; ensure CMS-compliant creatives/disclaimers.
