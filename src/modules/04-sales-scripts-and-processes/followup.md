# Playbook: Follow-up & Automation (SMS/Email)

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

This playbook defines the **automated, compliant text and email scripts** used for Speed-to-Lead and Nurture (as defined in Module 3).

**Compliance Mandate:** SMS (texting) is the highest-risk TCPA channel. All automated texts **must** be sent from the agency's approved tech stack (CRM/Dialer) and must adhere to three rules:
1.  **One-to-One Consent:** The lead must have given prior express written consent to *your agency by name*.
2.  **Identification:** You must identify yourself and the agency in the first message.
3.  **Opt-Out:** You must include a clear "Reply STOP" opt-out in every promotional message.

## 2.0 Core Scripts (Word-for-Word)
