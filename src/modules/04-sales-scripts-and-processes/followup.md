# Follow-Up

## Summary
- Multi-touch, multi-channel cadences tuned by lead type; speed and persistence drive conversion.
- Email for summaries/education; SMS for quick responses (with consent); calls for closes.

## Key Benchmarks
- SMS response ~45%; CTR 21–35%.
- Fresh leads: dense first 72 hours; aged leads: distributed over weeks.

## Compliance Notes
- TCPA consent and STOP in every SMS; DNC/time-of-day; record MA/ACA calls.
- CAN-SPAM for email; retain consent logs.

## Scripts/Processes
- SMS: appointment-set (“responding to your request… brief call?”), Day 3/7 follow-ups, aged re-engage.
- Email: no-show/reschedule, post-call summaries, ACA deadlines, IUL education drip.
- Call cadence: fresh (<5 min, then daily), aged (spaced touches), keep voicemails concise with ID.

## Action Plan
- Build cadences in CRM/automation; segment by product and lead freshness.
- Sync opt-outs to central DNC; ensure consent stored and visible to reps.
- Track activity KPIs (calls, connects, appts) and improve scripts via QA feedback.
