# Phone

## Summary
- Phone is highest converting channel; use decisive, value-forward openers and rapid SLAs.
- Tailor approach by lead type (fresh, aged, live transfer) and product.

## Key Benchmarks
- Fresh internet: 30–50% contact; 15–20% close with <5 min response.
- Aged: 10–20% contact; 5–10% close with persistence.
- Live transfer: 20–35% close if handled same call.

## Compliance Notes
- One-to-one consent; DNC/time-of-day; recording for MA/ACA; document disclosures.
- For variable/securities, FINRA 2210 balanced communications.

## Scripts/Processes
- Openers: pain-point (“policies don’t cover full mortgage”), peace-of-mind, delivery/“close my file” for aged.
- Live transfer: acknowledge context, qualify, move to application in-call.
- Objection flow: isolate → address → micro-commit; spouse present; budget-fit downsell.

## Action Plan
- Load scripts into dialer/CRM; set SLA <5 min for fresh leads; voicemail/text fallbacks.
- Train via role-play and call QA; track connects/sits/closes by lead type.
- Ensure recording and consent documentation linked to contact record.
