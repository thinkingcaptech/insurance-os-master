# Door-to-Door

## Summary
- Use D2D as follow-up for unresponsive leads (FE/MP), not blind canvassing.
- Position as “following up on your request” to reduce resistance; offer porch/table choice.

## Key Benchmarks
- Aged FE/MP follow-up improves contact vs. phone-only; rely on routing efficiency not volume stats.

## Compliance Notes
- No unsolicited MA/PDP D2D; do not pivot FE knock into MA discussion.
- Safety: route planning, check-ins, log visits in CRM.

## Scripts/Processes
- FE: “I’m following up on the card/online request about final expense—porch or kitchen, 10 minutes.”
- MP: “Assigned to get you the mortgage protection info—no time today; back on X or Y, 20 minutes. Which works?”
- Gatekeeper: “Dropping off the info they requested—are they available?” then confirm/appoint.

## Action Plan
- Build mapped routes for aged/response follow-up; log outcomes via mobile CRM.
- Train posture, distance, and choice close; avoid MA/PDP discussions unsolicited.
- Pair with mail/text/voice touches; track appointments set and sits from D2D.
