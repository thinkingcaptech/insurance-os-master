# Playbook: Door-to-Door Scripts

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

Door-to-door (D2D) is **not** a cold canvassing strategy. It is a **high-intent follow-up tactic** for leads that have already expressed interest but are unresponsive to the phone (e.g., Direct Mail returns or aged FE/MP leads).

This approach fundamentally changes the opener from "Can I interest you in...?" to "I'm the agent following up on the information you requested." This is a permission-based approach that builds trust and authority.

**Compliance Mandate:** It is **illegal** to market Medicare Advantage (MA) or Part D (PDP) products door-to-door. This is a zero-tolerance CMS rule.

## 2.0 Core Scripts (Word-for-Word)

### 1. Final Expense (Lead Follow-Up)

(Knock, step back 3-4 feet, hold the lead card or mailer visible in hand)

"Hi, are you [Prospect Name]?"
(Wait for "Yes...")
"Hi [Name], I'm [Agent Name]. I'm just following up on that information you requested online (or *'this card you mailed back'*) about the new state-regulated final expense programs. I have the info you requested right here."

(Assumptive, alternative-choice close):
"It only takes 5-10 minutes. Do you want to take care of it on the porch or at the kitchen table?"

### 2. Mortgage Protection (Appointment Set)

This is a low-pressure tactic to *set* the appointment, not run it on the spot.

"Hi, [Prospect Name]? I'm [Agent Name] with [Agency Name]. I'm the one who's been assigned to get you the mortgage protection information you requested."
(Show them the lead form/mailer)
"I actually **don't have time** to go over the programs today, but I'll be back in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday. It will only take about 20 minutes for me to share this. Which of those days works best for you?"

* **Analysis:** By stating "I don't have time," the agent removes all sales pressure, disarms the prospect, and makes the interaction about scheduling, not selling.

### 3. Handling Objections at the Door

* **"I'm busy":** "I understand completely. I'm actually scheduled to be in the area all day. I can come back in an hour, or would this afternoon be better?"
* **"I already handled it":** "That's fantastic, I'm glad you're protected. They must not have taken you off our list. Just so I can close my file, who'd you end up going with? (e.g., Mutual of Omaha). Oh, they're a great company. You got their whole life plan, right? Not the term that expires at 80?" (This pivots to a policy review).
