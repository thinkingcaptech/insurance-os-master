# Module 4: Sales Scripts & Processes

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

This module provides the **compliance-approved language** for every agent-client interaction. In the modern agency, "what you say" is not left to chance. Every script must be optimized for two mandates simultaneously:

1.  **Ruthless Efficiency:** Seize control of the conversation, build value, isolate objections, and move to a close in a predictable, repeatable framework.
2.  **Zero-Tolerance Compliance:** Every script must have TCPA, CMS, and NAIC-compliant language built-in. This includes consent, disclaimers, and the avoidance of prohibited, misleading phrases.

These scripts are the "software" that runs on the "hardware" of your tech stack. They must be housed in the LMS (Module 3) and executed daily (Module 5).

## 2.0 Core Script Libraries

* **[Phone & Telesales](phone/):** The primary engine for FE, MP, and ACA. Built for speed, control, and the one-call close.
* **[Door-to-Door](door/):** A high-intent follow-up playbook for unresponsive FE and MP leads.
* **[Virtual & Zoom](zoom/):** The primary channel for high-friction, educational IUL sales.
* **[Follow-up & Automation (SMS/Email)](followup/):** The automated, compliant text and email templates for speed-to-lead and nurture.
* **[Objection Handling](objections/):** The master framework (Acknowledge, Isolate, Overcome) and word-for-word rebuttals for the most common objections.
