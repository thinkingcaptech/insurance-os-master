# Sales Scripts & Processes

## Summary
- Dual mandate: ruthless efficiency (multi-touch to live calls) + zero-tolerance compliance (TCPA/CMS/NAIC).
- Channel-specific scripting: decisive phone openers; permission-based D2D; compliant SMS; segmented email.
- Process over product: standardized cadences, leading-indicator management, mandatory role-play/QA.

## Key Benchmarks
- Fresh internet leads: 30–50% contact; 15–20% close (1–14 days) when fast.
- Aged leads: 10–20% contact; 5–10% close over 7–30+ days.
- Live transfers: 20–35% close if handled real time.
- SMS response ~45%; CTR 21–35%.

## Compliance Notes
- One-to-one consent; DNC/time-of-day; STOP in every SMS; record MA/ACA calls 10 years.
- FINRA rules for variable products; avoid promissory/testimonial adoption on social media.

## Scripts/Processes
- Standard openers (pain-point, peace-of-mind, delivery/“close my file”) and objection flows.
- Role-play cadence (daily for <90-day agents, weekly for teams); call QA with scorecards.
- Cadences tailored to lead type (fresh, aged, live transfer) with SLA for first contact (<5 min).

## Action Plan
- 0–90 days: Load compliant scripts/SMS/email/D2D into CRM/LMS; enforce recording; schedule mandatory role-play.
- 6–12 months: Build lead-type cadences; deploy AI/QA for call feedback; mini-kits per product.
- 1–2 years: Iterate scripts from QA data; refine metrics to persistency/CPA; maintain compliance reviews.
