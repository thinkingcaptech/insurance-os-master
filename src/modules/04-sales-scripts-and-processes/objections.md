# Objections

## Summary
- Use isolate → address → micro-commit structure; keep spouse/decision-maker present; align to budget and needs.
- Common: “think about it,” “can’t afford,” “talk to spouse,” “already insured,” price/trust concerns.

## Key Benchmarks
- Success tied to role-play frequency and QA; monitor close rates post-objection handling.

## Compliance Notes
- Avoid misleading guarantees; for variable/securities, balanced claims; document suitability rationale.
- Stay within consent scope; no pressure tactics for seniors.

## Scripts/Processes
- Think about it: “Is it price, fit, or timing? If under $X/month fits and meets [stated need], ok to proceed today?”
- Can’t afford: downshift coverage responsibly; show value vs. risk; confirm budget ceiling.
- Spouse: reschedule with both; provide summary/options to share; don’t present without decision-makers.
- Already insured: policy review pivot—term expiry, convertibility, gaps; offer improvements only if justified.

## Action Plan
- Train via scheduled role-play; maintain objection script library by product.
- Document objections and resolutions in CRM; refine scripts based on QA outcomes.
- Reinforce suitability documentation and transparent cost/benefit explanations.
