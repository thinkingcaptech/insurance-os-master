# Playbook: Virtual & Zoom Scripts

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

The virtual (Zoom) presentation is the primary channel for **high-friction, educational sales** like IUL and annuities. Unlike a one-call-close FE sale, the virtual sale is a **multi-meeting process** built on education, trust, and visual aids (running the illustration).

**Compliance Mandate:** All virtual sales and marketing meetings (Zoom, Teams, etc.) **must be recorded and stored for 10 years** per CMS rules. This applies even if the meeting *starts* as non-Medicare but pivots to a Medicare question.

## 2.0 IUL Virtual Presentation Framework

### 1. The Opening (Setting the Agenda)

"Welcome. Just so we're on the same page, the goal for today is simple:
1.  First, I'm going to ask a few questions about your long-term financial goals.
2.  Second, I'm going to share my screen and show you how these IUL plans work—both the pros and the cons.
3.  Finally, if it looks like a good fit, we can run a personalized illustration to see what the numbers look like for you.
Sound fair?"

### 2. The Discovery (Needs Analysis)

"IULs are specialized tools. To see if this even makes sense, I need to understand your goals."
* "When you think about retirement, what's the magic number you have in mind?"
* "What are you currently doing to save for that (401k, IRA, etc.)?"
* "The big advantage of these plans is the tax treatment. How concerned are you about what tax rates might be when you go to pull that money out 20 years from now?"

### 3. The Education & Compliance (NAIC Mandates)

"Before I show you any numbers, I am required to make a few things crystal clear. This is a life insurance policy, not a 401(k) or a direct investment.

It has three main benefits:
1.  **The Death Benefit:** This is the primary purpose.
2.  **The 'Floor':** The cash value has a 0% floor, so you don't lose money from market losses. But, you are also *capped* in strong market years.
3.  **The Access:** You can access this value through tax-free policy *loans*, but you must manage the loan to prevent a taxable event.

**"The 3-4 Year Reality Check" (MANDATORY):**
"Most importantly, this is a long-term plan. You will likely not have any meaningful cash value to access for the first 3-4 years as the policy funds. This is a 10, 20, 30-year strategy, not a short-term savings account."

### 4. The Close (Presenting the Illustration)

(After sharing the screen and running the illustration)
"As you can see, based on your contribution of [X], this projects a tax-free loan potential of [Y] at age 65. Based on the goals you told me about, how does that look to you?"
