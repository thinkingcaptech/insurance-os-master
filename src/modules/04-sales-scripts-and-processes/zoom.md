# Virtual / Zoom

## Summary
- Virtual meetings for presentations, illustrations, and policy reviews; must be recorded for MA/ACA.
- Reliability: Zoom best for client-facing; Teams/Meet if already standardized internally.

## Key Benchmarks
- Recording retention: 10 years for MA/ACA sales/marketing calls.
- No-show reduction: confirmations + reminders via SMS/email.

## Compliance Notes
- Disclose recording at start; store securely with access controls.
- FINRA 2210 for variable content; avoid unapproved claims.

## Scripts/Processes
- Invite flow: scheduling link → confirm → reminder with recording notice and agenda.
- Meeting flow: intro + disclosure, agenda, screen-share illustration, recap/next steps, schedule follow-up.
- Post-call: send summary + recording link (if appropriate) and required disclosures.

## Action Plan
- Standardize meeting templates, agendas, and disclosures; enable auto-recording for relevant lines.
- Integrate scheduling (Calendly/Acuity) with CRM; log recordings/notes to contact.
- Train reps on screen-share etiquette and compliance phrasing; audit recordings periodically.
