# LMS / Training

## Summary
- LMS is both training delivery and compliance documentation; must track certifications/CE and completion.
- Options: Skillcast (compliance libraries), SmarterU (license/CE tracking), ProProfs (starter/free for small teams).

## Key Benchmarks
- Needs: certification tracking, assessments, reporting, content hosting (video/docs), role-based access.
- Recording libraries: host best-call examples and required compliance modules (TCPA/BI/AML).

## Compliance Notes
- Store completion records for audits; align modules to product-specific CE where possible.
- Role-based permissions to PHI/PII content; ensure vendor security/BAA if PHI involved.

## Scripts/Processes
- Onboarding path: licensing prep → compliance modules → product/sales process → role-play library.
- Recurring training cadence: weekly huddles + monthly advanced sessions; LMS quizzes to verify comprehension.
- Track expirations (licenses/CE) and notify agents automatically.

## Action Plan
- Select LMS aligned to compliance tracking needs; import required modules (BI, TCPA, AML, privacy).
- Upload playbooks/call recordings; set learning paths for new vs. veteran agents.
- Automate reminders for expiring licenses/CE; monitor completion reports and remediate gaps.
