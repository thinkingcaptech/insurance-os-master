# Component: CRM (Client Relationship Manager)

## 1.0 Strategic Mandate

The CRM is the **central nervous system** of the entire agency. It is not an optional tool; it is the primary defensive asset for managing compliance and the primary offensive asset for managing revenue.

All other systems (Dialer, Marketing Automation, Quoting) must integrate with the CRM. An agency-wide, mandatory-use CRM is the only way to manage **vicarious liability** for your agents' actions.

## 2.0 Core Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose & Justification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Centralized Logging** | The CRM **must** be the "single source of truth." It must automatically log every call, text, email, and note. This is a non-negotiable TCPA/CMS audit defense. |
| **2. HIPAA-Compliant Storage** | The CRM must be HIPAA-compliant, and you **must** have a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the vendor. This is required for storing all PHI, including applications and call recordings. |
| **3. Global Opt-Out** | The CRM must manage a global "Do Not Contact" list. When a lead opts out (e.g., "STOP"), it must be *instantly* and *automatically* synced, blocking them from all systems (dialer, email, text) to prevent TCPA violations. |
| **4. Native Dialer Integration** | The CRM must integrate seamlessly with the agency's **Compliant Dialer**. Agents must be able to "click-to-call" directly from the lead record, and all call dispositions and recordings must automatically save back to that record. |
| **5. Marketing Automation** | The CRM must have (or natively integrate with) a marketing automation system to execute **Speed-to-Lead** (sub-60-second lead response) and **Long-Term Nurture** (IUL/lead recycling). |
| **6. Pipeline Management** | Must provide clear, visual sales pipelines (e.g., "New Lead" -&gt; "Contacted" -&gt; "Appt Set" -&gt; "Appt Held" -&gt; "App Pending" -&-gt; "Issued") to accurately forecast revenue and manage agent activity. |
| **7. Reporting & Dashboards** | Must provide agent- and agency-level dashboards for tracking the core KPIs: Dials, Contacts, Appts Set, Appts Held, and Closes. |
