# Technology Stack Optimization

## Summary
- 2025 insurtech mandate: efficiency + auditability; pick ecosystem (all-in-one vs best-in-breed) with a hybrid recommended.
- Back-office AMS for policy/commissions/compliance + front-office best-in-breed (dialer, quoting, scheduling, marketing).
- Consent/recording/compliance capabilities now core selection criteria.

## Key Benchmarks
- CRM costs: HubSpot Free → $1,600+/mo Pro; Salesforce $25–$350+/user + implementation.
- AMS: AgencyBloc $65–$75/user; NextAgency $75/user + $120/agency; Better Agency $299–$549/agency.
- Dialers: Mojo ~ $149/user (triple), PhoneBurner $140–$183/user, MightyCall $30/user (Power).

## Compliance Notes
- One-to-one consent and DNC controls must be native/integrated; call recording retention needs (10 years for MA/ACA where applicable).
- BAA/DPAs for PHI/PII handling vendors; data security aligned to NAIC #668/GLBA.

## Scripts/Processes
- Hub-and-spoke rollout: implement core hub first, then integrate dialer/quoting/e-sign sequentially; pilot with small team.
- Consent/DNC architecture: single source of truth integrated across dialer/SMS/CRM.
- Vendor onboarding checklist: security, integrations, compliance (TCPA, HIPAA), support.

## Action Plan
- 0–90 days: Choose hub (AMS vs general CRM); enable recording/consent/DNC; select power dialer; pick scheduling/e-sign.
- 6–12 months: Integrate quoting/e-app (iPipeline/Ensight); deploy marketing automation; LMS for training/compliance; commission tracking.
- 1–2 years: Add AI (call notes/scoring/routing); optimize dashboards (sales/persistency/commissions); periodic vendor/security audits.
