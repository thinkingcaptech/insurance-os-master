# Marketing Automation

## Summary
- Use built-in automation if on HubSpot/Better Agency/Shape; pair third-party (ActiveCampaign/Mailchimp) with weaker CRMs/AMS.
- Drives nurture, consented SMS/email, landing pages, A/B testing, and analytics.

## Key Benchmarks
- ActiveCampaign: starts ~$19; strong visual builder; includes CRM/lead scoring.
- Mailchimp: easy entry; weaker automation; costs rise with list size.
- HubSpot: best-in-class but major jump at Pro tier.

## Compliance Notes
- Consent and opt-out management must sync with CRM/DNC; TCPA for SMS; CAN-SPAM/opt-out for email.
- CMS/CMS disclaimers for health; avoid misleading claims; record consent sources.

## Scripts/Processes
- Build segmented drips: FE/MP fast follow; ACA deadline reminders; IUL education series.
- Sync STOP/unsub events to central DNC; log consent with timestamps/source.
- Track offline conversions (e.g., funded loans) and feed back to ad platforms for optimization.

## Action Plan
- Select automation aligned to CRM; ensure bi-directional sync for contacts/consents.
- Create standard nurture templates per product; set SLAs for lead assignment and first touch.
- Implement analytics dashboards for open/click/response and downstream CPA/persistency.
