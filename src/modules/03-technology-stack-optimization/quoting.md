# Quoting & E-Apps

## Summary
- Goal: straight-through processing from quote to e-app with audit trails.
- iPipeline (LifePipe + iGO) is industry standard for Term/GUL; Ensight offers compliance-first multi-product illustrations.
- Trend toward universal e-apps (iLife; custom Salesforce portals).

## Key Benchmarks
- iPipeline pricing ~ $20/user/mo (UK model) with wide carrier network.
- Ensight: multi-product “single entry,” auditable Best Interest; pricing via demo.

## Compliance Notes
- Best Interest/like-for-like comparisons; store case revisions and rationale.
- Ensure e-app and signatures meet ESIGN/UETA; HIPAA considerations for PHI.

## Scripts/Processes
- “Single-entry” illustration where possible; save comparisons and disclosures to client file.
- Quote-to-apply workflow: select product, generate illustration, complete e-app, e-sign in one session.
- Replacement scenarios: include surrender/benefit comparisons in the illustration packet.

## Action Plan
- Choose quoting/e-app aligned to product mix (simple Term → iPipeline; complex IUL/VUL/LTC → evaluate Ensight).
- Integrate with CRM/AMS for data sync and document retention; link to BI documentation.
- Train agents on consistent quote-to-e-app flow; audit files for saved illustrations and disclosures.
