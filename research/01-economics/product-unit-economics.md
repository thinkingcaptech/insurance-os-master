# Product Unit Economics & Distribution Channel Analysis (2023–2025)

## I. Executive Analysis: Comparative View (2023–2025)
- **Two models**  
  - **Transactional (FE, ACA):** High velocity, lead-dependent, fast/advanced cash, high churn/chargeback (FE) or regulatory risk (ACA).  
  - **Compounding (MP, IUL):** Higher friction/barrier; relies on persistency. MP builds renewable annuity; IUL delivers large but high-risk/chargeback commissions.  
- **FYC alone is misleading:** Net profitability hinges on 13- and 25-month persistency and chargeback rules.  
  - FE: 110% FYC vs MA $694, but FE lapses 20–30% and 100% clawbacks on 6–9 mo advances.  
  - MP (Medicare): Low initial, but $347 renewal with high persistency, building a sellable annuity.  
- **Role framing:** FE = cashflow engine; MP (Medicare) = cornerstone asset; ACA = scalable PMPM stream with legislative risk; IUL = high-specialty profit center with multi-year chargeback liability.

## II. Core Economic Benchmark Comparison (2023–2025)

| Metric | Final Expense (FE) | Medicare Products (MP) | Affordable Care Act (ACA) | Indexed Universal Life (IUL) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avg. Annualized Premium | $900 – $1,000 | N/A (flat fee) | N/A (PMPM) | $5,500 – $6,000 |
| First-Year Commission | 80% – 120% of AAP | MA: $694 (2026 nat’l max); Supp: ~20% AAP | $18 – $27 PMPM | 70% – 95% of Target Premium |
| Renewal Commission | 5% – 10% (Yrs 2–10) | MA: $347 (2026 nat’l max); Supp: ~20% | $18 – $27 PMPM (some renewals drop to ~$20) | 1.5% – 5% (Yrs 2–10) or trails |
| 13-Mo Persistency | 70% – 85% | 85% – 95% | 70% – 85% (reg. risk) | 80% – 85% |
| 25-Mo Persistency | >75% (lower than trad WL) | 80% – 90% | 60% – 75% (high churn) | 75% – 80% |
| Chargeback Structure | 100% of 6–9 mo advance if lapse Y1 (Months 1–6: 100%; 7–12: 50%) | Minimal; as-earned monthly; recoup only if retro-termed | Minimal; as-earned PMPM; recoup if retro-termed | Severe, multi-year (e.g., 100% Y1, 90% Y2, 80% Y3…) |
| Placement Ratio (App → Issued) | High (80% – 90%) | Very High (95%+) | Very High (90%+) | Low–Med (60% – 70%; ~40% kicked to FUW) |

## III. Final Expense (FE)
- **AAP:** ~$990 (LIMRA-LIC 2024). Face: SI ~$14.5k, GI ~$9.8k.  
- **FYC:** 80–120% (new 80–90; experienced 90–110; top 110–120+; agency up to ~140).  
- **Renewals:** 5–10% Yrs 2–10 (modest).  
- **Persistency:** “Real-world” 13-mo ~70–80% (20–30% lapse); higher than trad WL lapse.  
- **Chargebacks:** Advances 6–9 months; Months 1–6 = 100% clawback; 7–12 = 50%. Net realization = FYC – (Lapse × Chargeback × Advance%).  
- **Placement:** High (simplified issue, no fluids); estimated 80–90%.

## IV. Medicare Products (MP: MA/MedSupp)
- **Commission basis:** Flat CMS-set dollars (2026: $694 initial; $347 renewal).  
- **FYC:** Paid as-earned monthly → minimal clawback exposure.  
- **Renewals:** 50% of initial each year member stays ($347).  
- **Persistency:** High (85–95%) by design; lock-in periods; retention is key value creator.  
- **Chargebacks:** Minimal (stop-pay on disenroll; minor recoup on rapid churn).  
- **Placement:** 95–100% (enrollment vs underwriting).

## V. ACA (Marketplace)
- **Comp model:** PMPM ($18–$27 typical; varies by state/carrier); paid monthly, new = renewal or slight drop.  
- **Persistency:** 70–85% but highly sensitive to subsidies; 2026 cliff risk if enhanced PTCs expire (premiums could double, causing lapses).  
- **Chargebacks:** Minimal; recoup PMPM on retro terms.  
- **Placement:** >90% (enrollment friction is admin/eligibility, not medical).  
- **Risk:** Legislative (subsidy expiration); model a lapse shock scenario.

## VI. IUL (Indexed Universal Life)
- **AAP:** ~$5,787 avg (LIMRA 2024); wide range due to funding patterns.  
- **FYC:** 70–95% but on Target Premium (not gross). Effective rate can be ~40% on gross if target is half of paid premium.  
- **Renewals:** ~1.5–5% on target; some asset-based trails.  
- **Persistency:** Model 80–85% (13-mo); 75–80% (25-mo) with elevated lapse risk in high-rate environment.  
- **Chargebacks:** Severe, multi-year (examples: 100% Y1, 50% Y2, 33% Y3, 25% Y4; or 100/90/80/70/60 over 5 yrs). High contingent liability; requires reserves.  
- **Placement:** 60–70%; AUW kick-to-full UW ~39%; ~8% declines; ~10% APS/add’l records = high friction and abandonment risk.

## VII. Strategic & Comparative Use
- **Cashflow:** FE = fastest advanced cash; ACA = steady PMPM; MP = lower initial but stable; IUL = large but lumpy and high liability.  
- **Risk:** FE/IUL high chargeback risk; ACA regulatory cliff; MP lowest financial risk (as-earned).  
- **Skill/friction:** FE/ACA low friction; MP moderate (certs/product); IUL high (UW, target-premium complexity, multi-year clawbacks).  
- **Blended FMO strategy:** Recruit with FE cash; cross-sell MP to build annuity asset; use ACA as scalable PMPM stream (hedge with cliff plan); graduate top producers to IUL once capitalized to absorb multi-year chargebacks.

### Note on templating/search
- Sticking with Eleventy + Nunjucks is fine. For reusable tables, consider NJK macros and storing product metrics in `_data` for re-render across modules.  
- For searchability, add a client-side index (lunr/elasticlunr) or Algolia DocSearch; keep front matter consistent (`title`, `tags`, `status`, `lastUpdated`) to include this file in collections.
