# The 2025 L&H Agency P&L Benchmark Report: A Financial Analysis of Solo, Growing, and Enterprise Agencies

## I. Executive Summary: The 2025 L&H Agency Performance Landscape

### A. The Central Paradox of the L&H Agency Model
- High-margin products (WL, UL, annuities) with significant FYC are offset by:
  - **Exceptionally high CAC:** $500–$1,500 per client.2
  - **Structurally high producer failure:** ~15 of 100 recruits remain after 4 years; ~89% quit within 3 years.3,4
- Profitability hinges on managing CAC and continuous investment in unvalidated producers; high margins alone do not guarantee profit.

### B. Best Practices vs. Average Performance
- **“Healthy” (Best Practices Study 2025):** 26.1% pro forma EBITDA; 10.7% organic growth.5
- **“Average” (At-Risk):** ~15–20% EBITDA.6
- **“Red Flag” (Distressed):** <15% EBITDA with margin compression, cashflow issues, and high churn.7

### C. Summary of Key Financial Benchmarks (2024–2025)
- **“Healthy” North Star:** EBITDA 26.1%; organic growth 10.7%; Rev/Employee $228,321; client retention >90%; NUPP 1.5%–2.0% of revenue.5,8,9
- **“Red Flag”:** EBITDA <15%; client retention <90%; inefficient growth: >15% marketing spend, high renewal splits, high churn.7,8,10

### D. Core Insight for Principals
- Valuations (8x–12x EBITDA in 2024) 11 are driven by profitability and sustainability, not gross revenue.
- Key levers: optimized commission structures, CAC management via retention, and treating NUPP as a strategic investment line.

### Table 1: Summary P&L Benchmarks by Agency Stage (2024–2025)

| Metric | Solo/Micro (1–3 Producers) | Growing (5–20 Producers) | Enterprise (20+ Producers) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rev. per Producer (Healthy) | $150,000 – $300,000 | $300,000 – $500,000 | $500,000 – $750,000+ |
| Total Producer Comp (% Rev) | 35% – 50% (Owner) | 25% – 35% | 25% – 30% |
| Total Staff/Mgmt Comp (% Rev) | 0% – 11% | 18% – 30% | 20% – 25% |
| Total OpEx (ex-Comp) (% Rev) | 10% – 20% | 15% – 20% | 12% – 19% |
| EBITDA Margin (Healthy) | 30% – 45%+ | 20% – 25% | 25% – 30%+ |

## II. Methodology and Foundational Benchmarks

### A. Framework: Producer Count to Revenue Proxy
- BPS segments by revenue bands; this report maps producer stages to those bands using productivity correlations.9,12
  - **Stage 1: Solo/Micro (1–3 producers):** aligns to BPS “Under $1.25M”; supplemented with 2019 IRS sole-prop data.13
  - **Stage 2: Growing (5–20 producers):** aligns to ~$1.25M–$25M revenue mid-market; NUPP becomes central.9
  - **Stage 3: Enterprise (20+ producers):** aligns to $25M–$100M and $100M+ BPS tiers; Healthy model sourced from 2025 BPS.5

### B. Productivity: Revenue per Producer (RpP) vs. Revenue per Employee (RpE)
- **Rev/Employee (RpE):** Whole-firm efficiency; 2025 BPS high = $228,321; At-Risk < $150,000.5
- **Rev/Producer (RpP):** Core sales productivity; must exceed producer commission plus fully-loaded service overhead.
- Red flag: RpP too close to RpE (e.g., RpP $250k vs. RpE $220k) signals bloat and weak leverage.5 Healthy RpP should be 2–3x support staff salary.

### C. Profitability: EBITDA and the Rule of 20
- **EBITDA:** Healthy 25–30%+; At-Risk 15–20%; Red Flag <15%.5,6,7
- **Rule of 20:** Organic Growth % + 0.5 × EBITDA %. Healthy (BPS 2025) = 25.1.5
  - Example risk: 30% EBITDA with 2% growth = 17 (At-Risk).
  - Example Healthy: 20% EBITDA with 12% growth = 22 (Healthy).

## III. P&L Benchmark Analysis: Solo/Micro Agency (1–3 Producers)

### A. Operational Profile
- Owner-as-producer; marketing-driven; high lead cost vs. volatile cash flow. Risk of being trapped in an unsellable “job.”

### B. Productivity Benchmarks
- **RpP (Healthy):** $150k–$300k → owner income $60k–$120k with room for OpEx.
- **RpP (Red Flag):** <$125k → below employed agent wage after CAC and G&A; unsustainable.15

### C. Table 2: Solo/Micro P&L Benchmarks (% of Revenue)

| P&L Line Item | “Healthy” Range (%) | “Red Flag” Range (%) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue per Producer | $150k – $300k | <$125k |  |
| Producer Comp (Owner) | 35% – 50%+ | <25% | Healthy = owner draw/profit; Red Flag = owner starving. |
| Staff Salaries | 0% – 11% | 10% – 15% | Healthy = $0 or 1 PT/FT admin; Red Flag = hiring before stable revenue. |
| Marketing / Lead Spend | 5% – 10% | 20% – 35%+ | Red Flag = lead-buying trap (high CAC/CPL). |
| Technology | 2% – 4% | <1% or >5% | <1% = no systems; >5% = subscription creep.16 |
| Rent / Office | 0% – 3% | 3% – 6% | Healthy = home office/small suite; IRS benchmark 3%.13 |
| Other G&A | 5% – 10% | 15% – 20% | Includes E&O, licenses, travel; Red Flag mirrors IRS 16% “other.” |
| Total Expenses | 55% – 70% | 85% – 100%+ |  |
| EBITDA Margin | 30% – 45%+ | <15% | Healthy solo can be very profitable; Red Flag is insolvent. |

### D. P&L Line-Item Analysis
- **Owner comp:** 35–50%+ as profit draw; <25% signals distress.7  
- **Staff:** $0–11% indicates leverage only when justified; early hires without revenue are Red Flag.13  
- **Marketing:** Healthy 5–10% niche/referral; >20% = paid-lead trap with CPL $400–$1,200 and CAC $500–$1,500.2,18  
- **Tech:** 2–4% for CRM/quote/e-sign; <1% unscalable, >5% creep.16  
- **Rent/G&A:** Keep lean (home office); IRS “other” at 16% is caution.13  
- **EBITDA:** <15% = break-even/negative; healthy solos can exceed 40%.7

## IV. P&L Benchmark Analysis: Growing Agency (5–20 Producers)

### A. Operational Profile
- Transition from owner-practice to scalable business; two cash-intensive investments: management layer and new producer development. Failure to invest or investing poorly creates stagnation or margin collapse.

### B. Productivity Benchmarks
- **RpP (Healthy):** $300k–$500k → covers commission plus full seat cost and overhead.  
- **RpP (Red Flag):** <$250k → producers drain cash (comp + support) and starve marketing/NUPP.

### C. Table 3: Growing Agency P&L Benchmarks (% of Revenue)

| P&L Line Item | “Healthy” Range (%) | “Red Flag” Range (%) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue per Producer | $300k – $500k | <$250k |  |
| Producer Compensation | 25% – 35% | 35% – 45%+ | Includes NUPP; Red Flag = bad splits or failed validation. |
| — NUPP (sub-item) | (1.5% – 2.0%) | (<0.5% or >3%) | Strategic investment; 0% = no talent pipeline.9 |
| Staff Salaries | 15% – 25% | <10% or >30% | Healthy supports producers; <10% = producers doing service; >30% = bloat. |
| Management Comp | 3% – 5% | 0% or >7% | 0% = owner still producing; >7% = top-heavy.19 |
| Marketing / Lead Spend | 4% – 8% | 10% – 20% | Healthy shift to brand/system; Red Flag = stuck in lead-buying. |
| Technology | 3% – 6% | <2% or >6% | Under = unscalable; over = bloat. |
| Rent / Office | 3% – 5% | 6% – 10% | Operating leverage should begin. |
| Other G&A | 5% – 7% | 10% – 15% | Tighter controls as maturity rises. |
| Total Expenses | 75% – 80% | 85% – 100%+ |  |
| EBITDA Margin | 20% – 25% | <15% | Healthy margin intentionally compressed to fund growth (Rule of 20).5 |

### D. P&L Line-Item Analysis
- **Producer comp + NUPP:** 1.5–2.0% of revenue reserved for NUPP signals deliberate talent R&D.5 0% = stagnation; >35% comp = payroll drain or poor splits.10  
- **Staff:** 15–25% shows leverage; <10% means producers doing service; >30% = bloat.5  
- **Management:** 3–5% for dedicated leadership; 0% owner-managed off-the-desk is chaos; >7% is heavy.19  
- **Marketing:** 4–8% maturing to brand/systems; >10% indicates lingering lead-buy dependency.  
- **EBITDA:** 20–25% with double-digit organic growth yields strong Rule of 20 (e.g., 12% + 0.5×20% = 22).

## V. P&L Benchmark Analysis: Enterprise Agency (20+ Producers)

### A. Operational Profile
- Professionally managed, high-value enterprise; focus on operating leverage, perpetuation, and maximizing enterprise value. Prime PE and public broker targets.22

### B. Productivity Benchmarks
- **Rev/Employee (Healthy):** $228,321 (BPS 2025).5 At-Risk < $175k.  
- **Rev/Producer (Healthy):** $500k–$750k+; Red Flag < $350k (seat-cost drain).

### C. Table 4: Enterprise Agency P&L Benchmarks (% of Revenue)

| P&L Line Item | “Healthy” Range (%) | “Red Flag” Range (%) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue per Employee | $225k+ | <$175k | BPS avg = $228,321.5 |
| Producer Compensation | 25% – 30% | 35% – 40%+ | Healthy = disciplined splits + NUPP; Red Flag = “fat and happy” culture.10 |
| — NUPP (sub-item) | (1.5% – 2.0%) | (0%) | Permanent talent R&D; 0% = dying firm.9 |
| Staff Salaries | 15% – 20% | 25% – 30%+ | Engine for RpE; Red Flag = bloat.5 |
| Management Comp | 5% – 7% | 10%+ | Professional layer; Red Flag = bureaucracy. |
| Marketing / Lead Spend | 3% – 5% | <1% or >8% | Mature brand spend; <1% = complacency. |
| Technology | 2% – 4% | 5% – 8% | Leverage via analytics/automation; >5% = redundancy.24 |
| Rent / Office | 2% – 4% | 5% – 8% | Operating leverage; Red Flag = empty desks. |
| Other G&A | 3% – 6% | 8% – 12% | Lowest % due to scale; >12% = waste.26 |
| Total Expenses | 70% – 75% | 80% – 90%+ |  |
| EBITDA Margin | 25% – 30%+ | <20% | Healthy aligns to BPS 26.1%.5 |

### D. P&L Line-Item Analysis
- **Producer comp:** 25–30% with institutionalized 1.5–2.0% NUPP; >35% signals lost comp discipline.10  
- **Staff/management:** 20–25% total delivers high RpE; >30% = bloat; 2025 BPS noted rising comp per employee diluting profit.5  
- **Marketing:** 3–5% brand/referral support; <1% = complacency; >8% = misaligned spend.  
- **Technology:** 2–4% for leverage; >5% implies redundant stacks/low adoption.24  
- **Rent/G&A:** 5–10% combined is hallmark of scale; >12% suggests empty desks or multi-office waste.26  
- **EBITDA:** 25–30%+ yields premium valuations (8x–12x EBITDA).11

## VI. Strategic Deep Dive: Marketing & Lead Generation Spend

### A. Two Models: Marketing-Driven vs Sales-Driven P&Ls
- **Marketing-driven:** Owner/agency sources leads; profitable < $2M but low ceiling.14  
- **Sales-force-driven:** Producers hunt with brand/marketing/NUPP support; the only scalable model to Growing/Enterprise.14

### B. Table 5: Marketing Spend Benchmarks (Growth vs Mature)

| Metric | High-Growth L&H Agency | Mature L&H Agency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marketing/Lead Spend (% Rev) | 15% – 30% 27 | 3% – 8% 13 |
| Primary Goal | Customer Acquisition | Retention & LTV |
| P&L Impact | High CAC; intentional margin compression | Stable spend to protect margins |
| Typical L&H CAC | $500 – $1,500+ 2 | <$500 (optimized/referral) |
| Typical L&H CPL (Paid Ads) | $400 – $1,200 18 | N/A (referral focus) |

### C. High-Growth Spend (15–30%)
- “Land grab” spend to validate new producers and acquire clients; uniquely dangerous due to high CAC/CPL.  
- Year-2 profit imperative: if FYC <$CAC, profit depends on Year-2+ renewals. High spend + retention <90% = top-tier Red Flag.

### D. Mature Spend (3–8%)
- Shift to brand/referral/retention; CAC drops, LTV-to-CAC becomes critical (target 3–5x+).13  
- Marketing supports inbound quality and cross-sell to maximize LTV.

## VII. Concluding Analysis: Three Levers for P&L Optimization & Agency Value

### A. Lever 1: Master Client Retention (Profitability Driver)
- Average retention 84–85% industry-wide; Best Practices 90–95%.8 Retention <90% is a buyer Red Flag.  
- High CAC means Year-1 often unprofitable; >90% retention unlocks renewal profit that funds NUPP, service team, and EBITDA.

### B. Lever 2: Systematize Producer Investment (Sustainability Driver)
- Producer force aging (WAPA 49.9 in 2024) 21; failure rates 85–89% in 3–4 years.3,4  
- Healthy firms budget 1.5–2.0% of revenue to NUPP as perpetual R&D.5 0% NUPP = “dying from the inside.”

### C. Lever 3: Achieve Operating Leverage (Valuation Driver)
- Drive RpE to $228k+ and EBITDA to 25–30%+.5,6  
- Red Flag Enterprise P&L resembles Solo: G&A >12%, Staff >30%, bloated tech/rent.  
- Healthy leverage decouples non-producer costs from revenue, producing premium EBITDA that attracts top multiples (8x–12x).11
