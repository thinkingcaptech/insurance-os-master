# Activity-to-Production Funnels

## Purpose
Synthesize activity benchmarks and conversion funnels for full-time independent agents across four product lines: Final Expense (FE), Mortgage Protection (MP), ACA Health Plans, and Indexed Universal Life (IUL).

**Data Sources:**
- `03-gemini-sales-scripts-processes.md` (contact rates, close rates)
- `01-gemini-lead-generation-systems.md` (conversion benchmarks)
- `product-unit-economics.md` (placement ratios, case sizes)

---

## Final Expense (FE)

### Activity Benchmarks (Full-Time Agent)
- **Daily Dials:** 80-120 (fresh leads), 150-200 (aged leads)
- **Weekly Dials:** 400-600 (fresh), 750-1,000 (aged)
- **Work Schedule:** 5-6 days/week, 6-8 hours/day

### Conversion Funnel (Fresh Leads)
| Stage | Rate | Example (100 Dials) |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Dials** | 100% | 100 |
| **Contacts** | 30-50% | 40 |
| **Appointments Set** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Appointments Held** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Apps Submitted** | 15-20% of held | 6 |
| **Policies Issued** | 85-90% of apps | 5 |

### Conversion Funnel (Aged Leads)
| Stage | Rate | Example (100 Dials) |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Dials** | 100% | 100 |
| **Contacts** | 10-20% | 15 |
| **Appointments Set** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Appointments Held** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Apps Submitted** | 5-10% of held | 3 |
| **Policies Issued** | 80-85% of apps | 2-3 |

### Production Benchmarks
- **Average Case Size:** $400-800 annualized premium
- **First-Year Commission:** 80-120% of AP
- **Weekly AP (Median Agent):** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Monthly Issued AP (Median Agent):** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Weekly AP (Top Quartile):** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Monthly Issued AP (Top Quartile):** *[NEED DATA]*

**Notes:**
- FE requires high daily activity (volume game)
- Fresh leads 3-4x more productive than aged
- Speed-to-lead critical: <5 min contact = 2-8% close; >1 hour = <1%

## Mortgage Protection (MP)

### Activity Benchmarks (Full-Time Agent)
- **Daily Dials:** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Weekly Dials:** *[NEED DATA]*

### Conversion Funnel (Fresh Digital Leads)
| Stage | Rate | Example (100 Dials) |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Dials** | 100% | 100 |
| **Contacts** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Appointments Set** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Appointments Held** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Apps Submitted** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Policies Issued** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |

### Production Benchmarks
- **Average Case Size:** $800-1,500 annualized premium
- **First-Year Commission:** 90-145% of AP
- **Weekly AP (Median Agent):** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Monthly Issued AP (Median Agent):** *[NEED DATA]*

**Notes:**
- Trigger leads banned Mar 5, 2026 (pivot to partner referrals)
- Partner/referral close rates: 15-25% (vs. 5-10% cold leads)
- Self-gen intent-signal funnels: 30-60% close rates

## ACA Health Plans

### Activity Benchmarks (Full-Time Agent)
- **Daily Dials:** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Weekly Dials:** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Work Schedule:** Seasonal (OEP surge Oct-Dec)

### Conversion Funnel (Paid Leads)
| Stage | Rate | Example (100 Dials) |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Dials** | 100% | 100 |
| **Contacts** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Appointments Set** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Appointments Held** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |
| **Apps Submitted** | ~11% of contacts | 11 |
| **Policies Issued** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |

### Production Benchmarks
- **Average Case Size:** $300-600/month premium
- **First-Year Commission:** $400-800 per enrollment
- **Renewal Commission:** $200-400/year
- **Monthly Enrollments (OEP):** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Monthly Enrollments (SEP):** *[NEED DATA]*

**Notes:**
- OEP (Oct 15-Dec 7) = 60-70% of annual revenue
- SEP/QLE always-on for life events
- Heavy compliance (CMS recording, scope of appointment)

## Indexed Universal Life (IUL)

### Activity Benchmarks (Full-Time Agent)
- **Daily Dials:** *[NEED DATA]* (lower volume, higher touch)
- **Weekly Dials:** *[NEED DATA]*
- **Work Schedule:** 5 days/week, relationship-driven

### Conversion Funnel
| Stage | Rate | Example (100 Dials) |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Dials** | 100% | 100 |
| **Contacts** | *[NEED DATA]* | *[CALCULATE]* |

- **Sales Cycle:** 3-4 meetings over 30-60 days

**Notes:**
- Education-based selling (3-4 touchpoints)
- Requires financial planning skills
- Higher case sizes = lower volume, higher value

## Top Quartile vs. Median Agent Performance

### Key Differentiators
*[TO BE SYNTHESIZED FROM RESEARCH]*

1. **Activity Level**

   - Median: *[Y]* dials/day

2. **Speed-to-Lead**
   - Top 25%: <5 min contact
   - Median: 1-4 hours

3. **Appointment Show Rate**
   - Top 25%: *[X]%*
   - Median: *[Y]%*

4. **Close Rate**
   - Top 25%: *[X]%*
   - Median: *[Y]%*

5. **Persistency**
   - Top 25%: *[X]%* 13-month
   - Median: *[Y]%* 13-month

## Data Gaps to Fill

### What I Already Have (From Existing Research):
- Contact rates (dials → conversations): FE 30-50% fresh, 10-20% aged
- Close rates (held appointments → issued): FE 15-20% fresh, 5-10% aged; ACA ~11%
- Case sizes: FE $400-800, MP $800-1,500, ACA $300-600/mo, IUL $3,000-8,000
- Commission structures: All products documented in compensation research

### What I Need (For Gemini to Synthesize):
1. **Appointment set rates** (conversations → appointments scheduled)
   - FE: fresh vs. aged
   - MP: digital vs. partner referrals
   - ACA: paid leads
   - IUL: relationship-driven

2. **Show rates** (appointments set → appointments held)
   - All products
   - Top quartile vs. median agents

3. **Weekly AP written** (per full-time agent)
   - Median and top quartile
   - By product line

4. **Monthly issued AP** (per agent)
   - Median and top quartile
   - By product line

5. **Daily/weekly activity levels for IUL**
   - Lower volume, relationship-driven model
   - Meetings per week, touchpoints per prospect
