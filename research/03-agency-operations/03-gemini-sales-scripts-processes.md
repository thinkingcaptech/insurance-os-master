# Sales Scripts & Processes (2025 Guide)

## Executive Summary
- Dual mandate: ruthless efficiency (multi-touch to live calls) plus zero-tolerance compliance (TCPA, CMS recording, NAIC Best Interest).
- Channel playbooks: decisive phone openers; permission-based D2D follow-ups; compliant, short SMS; segmented email (ACA urgency, IUL education).
- Process focus: standardized cadences by lead type, manage leading indicators (dials, connects, appointments), mandatory role-play/call QA.
- Product nuance: FE simplicity + trust; MP payment protection and partner referrals; ACA deadline/subsidy urgency; IUL education with 3–4 year cash value expectation.

## Channel & Script Highlights
### Phone
- Openers: pain-point (“policies don’t cover full mortgage”), peace-of-mind, “delivery” framing for aged leads; live transfer same-call close.
- Benchmarks: fresh internet leads ~30–50% contact / 15–20% close; aged leads 10–20% contact / 5–10% close; live transfers 20–35% close when handled real time.
- Cadence: fresh—first 5 minutes then dense first 72 hours; aged—multi-touch over weeks; live transfers—immediate.

### Door-to-Door (follow-up)
- Use for unresponsive leads, not blind canvassing. Route aged FE or new MP leads; open with “following up on info you requested” and porch/table choice.
- MP appointment set: “I don’t have time today; back on X/Y for 20 mins—what works?” Compliance: no unsolicited MA/PDP D2D.

### SMS
- High read/response; highest TCPA risk. Requires prior express written, agency-specific consent; identify sender; include “Reply STOP”; 8a–9p local.
- Templates: appointment-set (“responding to your request…”); open-ended check-in; Day 3/7 follow-ups; aged re-engagement.
- KPIs: ~45% response; CTR 21–35%.

### Email
- ACA: short, deadline/subsidy urgent (OEP/SEP reminders, confirmations).
- IUL/Whole: educational drip (myths → indexed growth → tax treatment → case study) before the call.
- No-show/reactivation: concise reschedule + summary; post-appointment recap for documentation.

## Objections & Closing
- Framework: isolate → address → micro-commit; manage budget-fit; reschedule with all decision-makers.
- Common objections: think about it, can’t afford, spouse not present, already insured (policy review pivot), price/trust.
- Closes: assumptive/alternative choice; urgency only when real (deadlines, rate/age-band changes); summary close with next steps.

## Compliance Guardrails
- TCPA: one-to-one written consent; identifiable sender; STOP in every SMS; time-of-day limits; avoid shared leads without proof.
- CMS/ACA/Medicare: record/store all sales/marketing calls and virtual meetings for 10 years; no unsolicited MA/PDP D2D.
- Suitability/Best Interest: document discovery, budget fit, alternatives; avoid misleading urgency or guarantees.

## Action Plan
- **Short-term (0–90 days)**: Standardize channel templates (phone/SMS/email/D2D) with compliance language; insert into CRM/LMS snippets. Enable universal call/meeting recording and consent capture; enforce 8a–9p sends; launch role-play calendar (daily for <90-day agents).
- **Medium-term (6–12 months)**: Build lead-type cadences (fresh, aged, live transfer) with SLAs and auto-reminders; deploy call QA/AI analysis; create product mini-kits (FE porch/table + leave-behind; MP payment-protection set; ACA deadlines; IUL education deck).
- **Long-term (1–2 years)**: Continuously refine scripts with QA data; integrate AI for screening, role-play, and call feedback; track leading indicators and persistency to tune offers; keep compliance reviews and STOP/consent logs audit-ready.

## Key Findings
Life & Health Insurance Sales: A 2024-2025 Operational Manual for Distribution, Scripts, and ComplianceEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The 2024-2025 Dual Mandate for Insurance SalesThe 2024-2025 landscape for life and health insurance distribution is defined by a high-friction environment, rising lead costs 1, and unprecedented regulatory scrutiny. Success in this period requires mastering a "Dual Mandate":High-Efficiency Personalization: Consumer attention spans are at an all-time low.2 This demands a sales process that is ruthlessly efficient, leveraging multi-touch automation (email, SMS) to drive prospects to the highest-converting event: a live phone conversation, which converts at a rate 10-15 times higher than web leads.3Absolute Compliance Adherence: Simultaneously, regulators have launched an unprecedented crackdown on sales and marketing. The 2025 TCPA updates 4, stringent CMS call recording mandates 5, and the NAIC's "Best Interest" standard 6 have created a zero-tolerance environment for non-compliance.This report is structured as a comprehensive operational manual to execute this Dual Mandate. It provides the word-for-word scripts, process workflows, and compliance guardrails necessary to build a scalable and defensible sales organization.Part 1: The Multi-Channel Sales ScriptsThis section details the initial contact scripts across all primary channels, optimized for specific lead types and products.Section 1.1: Phone Sales & Telesales MasteryThe telephone remains the single most critical tool for closing sales.3 The primary strategic shift in 2024 is away from traditional, slow-paced rapport-building and toward direct, value-driven openers that seize control of the conversation immediately.Cold Calling Scripts & Openers (General Insurance)When approaching a cold prospect, the opener must immediately establish relevance and credibility.The "Pain Point" Opener: This script identifies a common problem and positions the agent as a specialist.Script: “Hello, is that [Lead Name]? I'm [Agent Name] from [Company]. Many of our clients are finding that [relevant pain point, e.g., 'their old policies don't cover their full mortgage']. I specialize in [demographic, e.g., 'protecting new homeowners']. Have you experienced this?” 7The "Peace of Mind" Opener: This script uses an emotional appeal for life insurance.Script: “Good afternoon, [Lead Name]. This is [Agent Name] from [Company]. Life insurance ensures your family's financial security. Have you considered protecting them with a policy?” 7The "Direct Quote" Opener: This is a straightforward, no-frills approach.Script: “Hello, [Lead Name]. This is [Agent Name] from [Company]. I believe you could benefit from our life insurance policy. Can I provide you with a free quote?” 7Final Expense (FE) Lead Scripts (Warm/Aged)For warm leads (e.g., a Facebook or web request), the objective is speed and control. Top-performing telesales agents intentionally skip "How are you today?" This is a critical tactic. Modern prospects are "sales-aware" and have low attention spans; a neutral, direct, and controlled tone that avoids traditional rapport is more effective at disarming them.2 Rapport is built during the underwriting/needs analysis, not at the opener.2Word-for-Word FE Lead Script:Agent: "Hi, is this [Prospect Name]?"Prospect: "Yes..."Agent: "Hi [Prospect Name], this is [Agent Name] with [Company Name]. I'm calling you back with the Final Expense price quote you requested on [Facebook/our website]. I see that your zip code is [Zip Code], is that correct?" 2Analysis: This script is powerful for three reasons:It uses "calling you back," which implies a prior relationship and lowers the prospect's guard.It uses the trigger word "price quote," which is what the prospect was looking for and snaps their attention.2It ends with a simple, low-resistance confirmation question ("is that correct?") to get the first "yes" and establish a pattern of agreement.2Broker Positioning Script: This must be stated immediately after the introduction to build trust and preempt the "I need to shop around" objection.Script: "Great. Just so you know, I'm a licensed broker in. My job is simple: I shop over 30 of the top insurance companies to find you the best plan that fits your budget. It'll just take a few minutes to get you that pricing. What you do with it is totally up to you." 2Aged Lead Follow-Up ScriptsAged leads (leads that are 60-90+ days old) require re-establishing context and acknowledging the time lapse.9 The agent cannot assume the prospect remembers filling out the form.The "Polite Re-Introduction":Script: “Hello, is this [Name]? Hi [Name], my name is from [Agency]. A while back, you'd requested some information online about life insurance to protect your family's future. I'm just following up to see if you were still in need of that.” 10The "Life Has Changed" Angle: This is a highly effective approach for aged leads.Script: “Hello [Name], it's with [Agency]. I'm reaching out because you requested a life insurance quote about 6 months ago. A lot can change in that time, and I wanted to see if protecting your family was still a priority.” 10Appointment Setting ScriptsThe key to appointment setting is to sell the appointment, not the policy. The scripts must focus on being "brief," "no-obligation," and "educational" to remove friction from the "yes".11The "Educational" Script:Script: “Good day, [Prospect's Name]. Did you know that life insurance can provide financial security... in case of unexpected events? I'd like to share some information with you about how it works... Is now a good time for a quick chat?” 11The "Direct Appointment" Script:Script: “Good [Morning/Afternoon], [Prospect's Name]. I believe I can help you secure your family's future... Could we schedule a brief, no-obligation meeting or phone call to explore your options?” 11The "Problem/Solution" Script: This script, from 12, focuses on asking questions to get the prospect to identify a problem.Script: "What if you could... 'If I could show you how to get the life insurance you need, without you spending any additional money or changing your lifestyle? Then would it be worth sitting down and talking about it?'" 12Telesales Benchmarks (KPIs)An agent's closing ratio is less a measure of their skill and more a measure of the lead's intent. Agency owners must benchmark by lead source to get a true picture of performance. For example, a 15-20% close rate on "garbage" internet leads is considered "pretty good".13 However, consumer-initiated inbound calls should have a 30% or higher average close rate.14 Live transfers also have "high closure chances" because the intent is pre-qualified.15Average Call Length: Varies dramatically by product. Final Expense calls are transactional and aim for a one-call close, often lasting 20-45 minutes. IUL/Whole Life calls are educational and part of a multi-call process 1, with initial discovery calls lasting 15-30 minutes and full presentations lasting 60-90 minutes.Table 1: Phone Sales KPI Benchmarks (by Lead Source)Lead SourceContact Rate (1st attempt)Lead-to-Appointment %Talk-to-Close %Est.

It is using D2D as a high-intent follow-up for leads that are unresponsive to phone/text. Top producers purchase aged Final Expense leads 19 or new Mortgage Protection leads 20 and use mapping software (like Google My Maps) to create an efficient route.19This fundamentally changes the opener from "Can I interest you in insurance?" to "I'm the agent following up on the information you requested." This is a permission-based approach that immediately lowers resistance.17Door Approach & Opening LinesThe "Lead Follow-Up" (Final Expense): (Knock on the door, step back 3-4 feet, maintain a friendly posture).Script: "Hi, are you [Prospect Name]? Hi [Name], I'm [Agent Name]. I'm just following up on that information you requested online about the new state-regulated final expense programs. I have the info you requested right here. It only takes 5-10 minutes. Do you want to take care of it on the porch or at the kitchen table?" 19Analysis: This is an assumptive, alternative-choice close (porch or table) that assumes the meeting is happening.The "Appointment Set" (Mortgage Protection): This is a highly effective, low-pressure tactic.Script: "Hi, [Prospect Name]? I'm [Agent Name] with [Agency]. I'm the one who's been assigned to get you the mortgage protection information you requested.20 I don't have time to go over the programs today, but I'll be back in the area on and. It will only take about 20 minutes for me to share this important information. Which of those days works best for you?" 21Analysis: By stating "I don't have time," the agent removes all sales pressure, disarms the prospect, and makes the interaction about scheduling, not selling.21Handling Gatekeepers and ObjectionsGatekeeper (Spouse, Child): "Hi, I'm [Agent Name]. I'm dropping off the information [Prospect Name] requested about their mortgage/final expense plan. Are they available?" (This positions the agent as a "delivery person," not a salesperson)."I'm busy": "I understand completely. I'm actually scheduled to be in the area all day. I can come back in an hour, or would this afternoon be better?""I already handled it": "That's fantastic, I'm glad you're protected. They must not have taken you off our list. Just so I can close my file, who'd you end up going with? (e.g., Mutual of Omaha). Oh, they're a great company. You got their whole life plan, right? Not the term that expires at 80?" (This pivots to a policy review).Safety & Territory ManagementThe Medicare "Firewall": While D2D is effective for life insurance 18, it is strictly prohibited for marketing Medicare Advantage (MA) or Prescription Drug Plans (PDP).23 Agents may not market MA/PDP door to door, which includes leaving materials at a beneficiary's doorstep.23This presents a critical compliance trap. Many agents cross-sell Final Expense to their Medicare clients.24 An agent might be tempted to knock on a door for Final Expense (which is legal) and then pivot to an MA plan (which is illegal unsolicited contact). Agents must be trained that any unsolicited D2D contact cannot be used to discuss MA/PDP plans.Safety Protocols: Always park in a well-lit area, never enter a home if you feel unsafe, let a manager or colleague know your mapped route, and use a CRM mobile app to log visit outcomes in real-time.Section 1.3: Text Message (SMS) CadencesSMS is the most effective channel for initial contact and appointment setting due to its 95%+ read rate 25 and high response rates (45% response rate vs. 90-second open time).25 However, it carries the highest compliance risk.The TCPA "Time Bomb"The 2024-2025 regulatory environment for texting is severe.4 The "lead generator loophole" is being closed 27, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) rules are being strictly enforced.28 Any agent texting leads without prior express written consent is at high risk for $500 to $1,500 per text fines.30This consent must be explicitly for the agent's agency. "Pre-checked boxes... are not valid".30 "Don't assume verbal agreement is enough".28 This means the common practice of buying a shared lead and immediately texting it is now extraordinarily risky. The strategic implication is a massive industry shift toward exclusive leads or "warm inbound transfer" models to mitigate this risk.Initial Contact Messages (Compliant)Template 1 (Appointment Setting): "Hello [first]. This is [your name] from [agency name], responding to your request for life insurance information. Are you available for a brief call to review your quote? Reply STOP to unsubscribe." 32Template 2 (Open-Ended): "Hey [name], This is [Agent] from [insurance company]. Are you looking for a new insurance provider? I can help you find the perfect coverage — let's chat. Is there a particular date and time that works for you?" 33Follow-Up & Re-engagement SequencesDay 3 (No Response): "Hi [first], just following up on the [product] quote you requested. I found a few options that could save you money. Let me know if you're free for a 5-min call. -[your name]. Reply STOP to unsub."Day 7 (No Response): "Hi [first], I'm [your name] from [agency name]. We recently had a meeting regarding your insurance needs. Have you finalized yet? I'll be happy to answer if you have more questions. Reply STOP to unsub." 32Aged Lead Re-engagement: "Hi [Name], it's with [Agency]. A while back you requested info on life insurance. Is securing your family's future still a priority? Let me know. Reply STOP to unsub." 10Table 2: TCPA Compliance Checklist (Do's and Don'ts)RequirementDODON'TPrior ConsentGet prior express written consent.28 Use unchecked boxes.30 Keep detailed records of how and when consent was given.29Do NOT assume consent from a shared lead. Do NOT use pre-checked boxes.30 Do NOT assume verbal consent is sufficient.28IdentificationClearly identify yourself and your agency name in the first message.28Do NOT send anonymous texts or use misleading names.28Opt-OutProvide a clear and easy opt-out (e.g., "Reply STOP") in every promotional message.28 Honor opt-outs immediately.30Do NOT force a client to call or email to opt out.28 Do NOT ignore opt-out requests.TimingSend messages only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the recipient's time zone.27Do NOT send messages at night or in the early morning.KPIs: Response Rate BenchmarksText messages have an average click-through rate of 21-35% 34 and a 45% response rate 25, dwarfing email. SMS delivers 2x-5x the ROI of email for time-sensitive campaigns.35Section 1.4: Strategic Email SequencesEmail is the primary tool for education, nurturing, and compliance documentation. Its function is product-dependent. For ACA, it is a transactional reminder system.36 For IUL/Whole Life, it is a conceptual education system.37 An ACA prospect is driven by a hard deadline (Open Enrollment) and cost (subsidies).36 The emails must be short, urgent, and action-oriented. An IUL prospect is considering a complex, long-term financial strategy.37 The emails must be educational, build trust, and explain complex ideas.Lead Nurture Sequences (IUL/Whole Life)This sequence is designed to educate the prospect on the concepts of IUL before a sales call.Email 1 (Day 1): Subject: The 3 Myths About Life Insurance. (Welcome, deliver lead magnet, introduce the concept of "living benefits").Email 2 (Day 3): Subject: Grow Your Money Without the Downside? (Explain the 0% floor and "indexed" concept vs. direct market risk).37Email 3 (Day 7): Subject: A Retirement Strategy the IRS Doesn't Tax. (Introduce the concept of tax-deferred growth and potential tax-free policy loans).37Email 4 (Day 10): Subject: A quick question for you... (Ask for a 15-minute call to "run a personalized illustration").ACA Enrollment EmailsThis sequence is transactional and built around the Open Enrollment (OEP) period: Nov 1, 2024 - Jan 15, 2025.36Email 1 (Start of OEP):Subject: Open Enrollment 2025 is Here - Time to Secure Your Health Coverage!Body: "Dear [firstname], It's that time of year again – Open Enrollment for health insurance is officially underway! This is your opportunity to review your current coverage... Here are some key dates to keep in mind: Open Enrollment Period: November 1, 2024 to January 15, 2025. Coverage Start Date: January 1, 2024 (if enrolled by December 15, 2024). I'm here to help... Please call [agentphonenumber] or reply..." 36Email 2 (Mid-OEP Reminder):Subject: Don't Miss Out on Open Enrollment '25 - Act Now!Body: "Dear [firstname], This is a friendly reminder that the Open Enrollment period for health insurance will be ending on December 15, 2024, for January 1st effective dates. Time is running out... I would like to set up a time to review your health insurance plan..." 36Email 3 (After Enrollment):Subject: Thank You for Enrolling in Open Enrollment 2025Body: "Dear [firstname], Your health coverage is now secured for 2025. Thank you for choosing... Here are your next steps: 1. Make Your First Payment:... 2. ID Cards and Welcome Packet:... 3. Keep Us Updated: If your income or household changes... contact us..." 36Appointment/Follow-Up EmailsConfirmation:Subject: Confirming our call:.Body: "Hi [Name], this confirms our appointment on at to discuss your [Product] options. Please let me know if anything changes. -[Agent Name]" 39No-Show:Subject: We missed you.Body: "Hi [Name], I had you down for our call today at. I'm sure you just got busy. Please reply to this email or use my calendar link ([Link]) to find a new time that works for you."Part 2: The Core Sales FrameworkThis section covers the in-person or telesales presentation, from discovery to close. The goal is not to sell a product, but to have the client discover a need that the product solves.Section 2.1: Presentation & Needs AnalysisThe "Basic Needs Analysis" is the framework for the entire presentation.40 This is the true start of the sale and where rapport is built.Needs Analysis QuestioningThe agent's job is to listen and apply knowledge to the client's goals.40 Key questions include:"Who would you like to protect?" (Identifies beneficiaries) 41"How long will they need financial support?" (Determines term length) 41"How much debt do you have?" (e.g., mortgage, credit cards) 41"How much do you have in savings?" (Identifies the "gap") 41"Were you planning on assisting with your dependents' continued education?" (Education fund) 41"Will your spouse need assistance to fund their retirement?" (Spousal income) 41"If you were to pass away, what is the most immediate financial problem your family would face?" (This uncovers the primary pain point, e.g., "The funeral," "The mortgage payment").The "Kitchen Table" Presentation FrameworkThis framework, based on the script from 44, is a masterclass in psychologically guiding a prospect to a sale. It is designed to be presented at the kitchen table 42 and preemptively eliminates all common objections.Step 1: Rapport & Confirmation: After initial rapport-building, sit at the table.Script: "The first thing I like to start with is just confirming some of the health information...source then we're good to go." 44Step 2: Broker Positioning: This frames the agent as an ally who shops for the client, rather than a salesperson who works for one company. This builds trust and defuses the "I need to shop around" objection.Script: "So the name of our company is Symmetry Financial Group. We are a broker and we partnered with 30-40 different insurance companies... My job is to look at your health, age, and your ultimate goal with this coverage, and find the right company, product, and price that accomplishes your goal." 44Step 3: Create Urgency & Define Need:Script: "Now I know this is a crazy statistic but every 17 minutes someone buys mortgage protection and doesn't live long enough to pay the 2nd premium, meaning they got it just in time... 98% of all Americans don't have... enough coverage to protect their mortgage..." 44 (This is followed by the Needs Analysis questions from the previous section).Step 4: Inoculate Against Competitors: This is the most crucial step. The agent proactively attacks competitor products to eliminate them from the prospect's mind.vs. Lender MPI: "The first kind you may see is decreasing term. This is the old school way... The problem is that your... coverage... decreases, but your premiums don't... The second problem is that the bank is the beneficiary. So if you pass away, your family doesn't get anything, the bank does. It takes all the control... away from your family." 44vs. Annual Renewable Term (ART): "The next kind is Annual Renewable Term. The prices on this policy start really low... But they go up in price every year so at some point it gets too expensive to afford and most people cancel the policy." 44vs. Fully Underwritten: "The next type of coverage is Full Med. This is where a nurse comes out... The main problems... is first, they always quote you PREMIER rates which are almost impossible to qualify for... And the second issue I have is that if you are declined with this coverage, it goes on your MIB record and you are now blacklisted from most insurance companies." 44Step 5: Present Your Solution (The "Hero"):Script: "Now with our type of coverage, there is no medical exam, no blood work, no medical records... The insurance carrier is going to take all the risks." 44 (This section is where the agent highlights differentiators like Return of Premium (ROP) and Living Benefits, referred to as the "safety net" 44).Step 6: The Trial Close & Options: Present 3-4 options (e.g., Cover the entire mortgage, Cover 50%, Cover just 1-2 years).Script: "There are two products I am going to show you Term and ROP... ROP works the same way [as term], except if you are still alive at the end of the term, you get all of your money back dollar for dollar. ROP is the better option, term is the cheaper option. We're going to start with ROP but if we don't find something that fits your budget... we can definitely switch to term." 44Storytelling Techniques (IUL/Whole Life)For complex products like IUL, features (caps, participation rates) confuse people. Stories and simplified concepts are what sell.37The Concept: "Instead of talking about technical specs, start with real-life scenarios: 'Want to grow your money without losing it when the market drops?' 'Would you like a retirement income stream that's not taxable?'" 37The Story (for Living Benefits): "We had a lady who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. She needed an experimental drug but her HMO didn't cover it... She needed $100k... Luckily she had the safety net, and she used $100k of her policy to pay for the drug... and it cured her cancer and she lived." 44Section 2.2: Frameworks for Overcoming ObjectionsThe universal framework is Acknowledge - Isolate - Overcome (AIO).46 Never argue; validate the prospect's concern, clarify the real issue, and then re-direct to a solution.Objection 1: "I need to think about it"The Real Reason: This is a smokescreen for an unvoiced objection, typically related to price, trust, or complexity.46Acknowledge: "I completely understand the need to think things through. This is an important decision." 46Isolate: "When you say you need to 'think about it,' what exactly are you planning to think about? Is it the coverage itself, the premium, or perhaps something else entirely that's on your mind?" 46Overcome: Once the real objection is voiced (e.g., "It's the price"), pivot to the "I can't afford it" script.Objection 2: "I can't afford it"The Real Reason: The value has not been established, or the agent has offered too much coverage.Acknowledge: "I hear you, it is a little tougher these days. I can appreciate that." 49Isolate (Re-frame): "But, when it comes down to it either you are going to have to sacrifice [a small monthly premium], or your family is going to have to sacrifice [by losing their home/paying for your funeral]. Obviously, you love your family very much otherwise you wouldn't have sent this card in." 49Overcome (Alternative Choice): "If you don't have $7,500 in savings right now... your kids will sacrifice. We can buy you time with this plan. Again, which plan is more manageable for you the $50/month or the $70/month plan?" 49Objection 3: "I need to talk to my spouse"The Real Reason: This is often a valid objection, but it can also be a polite stall.46 The best solution is prevention: always attempt to present to both spouses together.50Acknowledge: "That's perfectly reasonable, and I encourage you to involve your spouse in such important financial decisions." 46Isolate: "When you talk to them, what part of this do you think they'll be most excited about? And what part do you anticipate they might have questions on?" 46Overcome (Schedule Joint Meeting): "That's exactly what we should cover. Would it be helpful if we scheduled a brief call when your spouse is also available? That way, I can directly answer any questions... I have or available." 46Objection 4: "I already have insurance"The Real Reason: They may be underinsured, have the wrong type, or have a policy that expires.Acknowledge: "That's great, you're ahead of the game. It's smart you already have that in place."Isolate: "Just so I can update my notes, is that a policy you picked up through work, or is it a personal plan you own?" (Work policy is often not portable). "Is that a term plan that expires, or is it a permanent whole life plan?" 2Overcome (Policy Review): "That's a great start. While your existing policy might support your family's long-term needs, final expense insurance specifically ensures immediate costs are covered without your loved ones having to wait for estate processing." 52Table 3: Objection Handling Matrix (AIO Framework)ObjectionThe Real Reason (The "Stall")Word-for-Word Rebuttal (Isolate & Overcome)"I need to think about it."Unspoken concern (usually price or trust)."I understand. When you say 'think about it,' what specific part are you mulling over? Is it the coverage, the premium, or something else?" 46"I can't afford it."Value not established, or plan is too large."I hear you. But it's a choice of sacrifice: you sacrificing a small amount, or your family sacrificing everything. Which of these is manageable, the $50 or $70 plan?" 49"I need to talk to my spouse."Valid need or a polite stall."That's smart. When you talk to them, what questions do you think they'll have?... You know, it might be easier if we find 15 minutes for all three of us. When are you both free?" 46"I already have insurance."Belief they are covered (but may be underinsured)."That's great. Is that a permanent plan, or a term plan that expires?... While your existing policy might support long-term needs, this is designed to specifically cover immediate costs." 52Section 2.3: Professional Closing TechniquesClosing is not a single, high-pressure question; it is the logical, assumed next step of a well-run presentation.The Assumptive CloseApplication: This is used when the prospect is showing strong buying signals (nodding, asking "what's next," positive language). The agent assumes the sale is made and proceeds confidently to the application.53Script (Application): "Based on everything we've discussed, this [Plan Name] is a great fit for you. Let's get your application started today so you can lock in this rate... I'll just need a few details to get you set up." 55Script (Data Collection): When asking for sensitive information like a Social Security Number, the tone is critical. It must be casual, "matter-of-fact" 2, and confident, as if it's just the next box on the form.Script: "Just like every company they do a medical and a prescription background check using your social number. So go ahead and hit me with your social number." 2The Alternative Choice CloseApplication: This technique provides two "yes" options, giving the prospect a feeling of control over how they buy, not if they buy.56Script (Appointment Setting): "I have availability this Tuesday at 6:00 PM or Wednesday at noon—which would work better for your schedule?" 57Script (Product Close): "So of the options we discussed, which one is the most comfortable fit for your budget, the $7,500 plan or the $10,000 plan?" 49Creating Ethical Urgency"Pushy" scarcity (e.g., "This offer ends today!") fails and alienates modern consumers.58 Ethical urgency is based on real-world facts that the client cannot change.Urgency of Health: "You need protection now.60 None of us knows what tomorrow holds. This rate is based on your health today. If something changes next week, you could be rated higher or even become uninsurable."Urgency of Age: "Rates are based on your 'insurance age,' which is often your closest birthday, not your last one. By waiting, you risk a permanent price increase for your birthday."Urgency of Qualification: "My job is to get this application in while you're in good health. Let's lock this in so you have peace of mind." 55Part 3: Product-Specific & Operational StrategiesDifferent products require different sales processes, funnels, and positioning.Section 3.1: Product-Specific Sales StrategiesFinal Expense (FE)Approach: A simplified, high-velocity, empathy-based sale.Target Market: Seniors (typically 50-85).61Positioning: This is not a wealth-building tool.62 It is a gift of love.Script: "This is a small whole life policy designed to give you peace of mind.61 The average funeral in the U.S. is over $8,300.8 This plan is designed to cover those specific end-of-life costs—like the funeral, burial, and final medical bills—so your loved ones don't have to face those burdens during a difficult time."Key Differentiator: Simplified or "guaranteed issue" underwriting, meaning no medical exam.63Table 4: Product Comparison: Final Expense vs. Traditional Whole LifeFeatureFinal ExpenseTraditional Whole LifePrimary GoalCover specific end-of-life costs (funeral, medical) 62Wealth transfer, cash value accumulation, large "gap" coverageCoverage AmountLow ($5,000 - $25,000) 62High ($100,000+)UnderwritingSimplified or Guaranteed Issue (No exam) 63Full Medical Exam (Typically)PremiumsLower monthly premium 62Higher monthly premium 63Cash ValueSlow growth 62Faster, more significant growthMortgage Protection (MP)Approach: An asset-protection sale for new homeowners. The core strategy is to not sell "MPI," but to sell a level term life policy and position it as superior to the mortgage insurance offered by the client's lender.The "Term Life vs. Lender MPI" Pivot: The client has a problem: "what happens to my mortgage if I die?".64 The lender offers a solution (Lender MPI), but it is a flawed product.65 The agent's level term life policy is the superior solution.Positioning Script: "It's critical to understand that the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) you're paying protects the lender.64 It does not protect your family. The mortgage protection plan your lender offers has two major problems:The bank is the beneficiary, not your family.65The benefit amount decreases as you pay your mortgage, but your premium stays the same.65The plan I'm showing you is a level term life policy. This means the benefit never decreases, and the money goes directly to your family, tax-free. They can decide what to do with it—pay off the house, cover income, or invest it. It gives them options."Table 5: Product Comparison: Lender MPI vs. Term LifeFeatureLender's Mortgage Insurance (MPI)Agent's Term Life PolicyBeneficiaryThe Lender 65Your Family (or chosen beneficiary) 66Benefit AmountDecreases with your mortgage 65Level for the entire term 66FlexibilityNone.

Tied to the loan.68Fully portable. You own it.ACA (Affordable Care Act)Approach: A transactional, compliance-driven, and time-sensitive process. The agent acts as a navigator.69Positioning: "My job is to help you navigate the Marketplace. Based on your estimated 2025 income, you may qualify for a large subsidy, or premium tax credit, to lower your monthly cost. My service is free. I'll check your doctors, prescriptions, and help you find the plan that gives you the best coverage for the lowest cost."Process:Consent: Obtain and document Consumer Authorization before starting.70Needs Analysis: "What's your estimated household income for 2025? Who is in your household? What doctors/hospitals are 'must-haves'? What prescriptions do you take?"Quote & Enroll: Present options, highlighting the "subsidy" (premium tax credit).Attestation: Review the application and document the Eligibility Attestation.70Follow-Up: Send "Thank You & Next Steps" email (See Section 1.4).36Key Compliance: ALL consent and attestation forms must be stored for a minimum of 10 years.70IUL/Whole LifeApproach: An education-based, conceptual, multi-meeting sale.Positioning: This is sold as a financial tool, not just insurance. It is positioned as a "Life Insurance Retirement Plan (LIRP)" 71, a 401(k) alternative 72, or a "tax-free" savings vehicle.37Sales Process:Education: Use email nurture sequences (See Section 1.4) and storytelling to explain the concept of cash-value growth, indexed interest, and tax-free loans.37Discovery: In-depth needs analysis focused on long-term financial goals, retirement gaps, and tax concerns.41Presentation: Use visual aids and illustrations to show projected cash value growth.Compliance Risk: This product has the highest risk of misrepresentation.74 The sales pitch must be balanced with disclosures (See Part 4.2).Section 3.2: Sales Process & Pipeline ManagementSales Cycle Length by ProductFinal Expense: Very short. Often a one-call close. The business is built on lead volume and sales velocity.1Mortgage Protection / ACA: Short to medium. 1-7 days. Driven by an external event (new home purchase, OEP deadline).IUL / Whole Life: Very long. Weeks or months. This is a "traditional life insurance sale" 1 that requires education, trust-building, and coordination with other financial assets.Best Practices: Multi-Touch Follow-Up CadencesA multi-channel (Call, SMS, Email) cadence is non-negotiable.76 A single channel will fail. A sales cadence is a predefined sequence of touchpoints to engage a lead.78Table 6: Multi-Touch Follow-Up Cadence Example (21-Day Plan for a New Web Lead)DayChannelAction/ScriptDay 0 (0-2 Mins)Phone Call 1Call Immediately. No voicemail.Day 0 (2 Mins)SMS 1"Hi [Name], this is [Agent] w/ [Agency] about the quote you requested. I just tried calling. Are you free for a quick call? Reply STOP to unsub." 32Day 0 (3 Mins)Phone Call 2Call again ("Double-Tap"). Leave Voicemail.Day 0 (5 Mins)Email 1Subject: Your [Product] Quote. "Hi [Name], I just left you a voicemail...

Is [Product] still a priority for you?"Day 21 79Email 3Subject: Closing your file. (The "Break-Up Email"). "Hi [Name], I'm assuming protecting your family is no longer a priority... If that's not the case, please let me know..."CRM DocumentationA CRM is the central hub for sales and compliance.Pipeline Management: Use defined sales stages (e.g., New Lead -> Contacted -> Appointment Set -> Presented -> Application Pending -> Closed) to visualize the flow of revenue.80Automation: Use the CRM to automate the follow-up cadence 76 and set task reminders for policy renewals or follow-up calls.81Compliance: The CRM must be used as a compliance database. It must store all compliance documents: call recordings, email consent, SMS opt-ins, and ACA attestations.70 This is the agent's only defense in an audit.Part 4: The 2024-2025 Compliance MandateThis is the most critical section of this manual. Failure to adhere to these rules can result in agency-ending fines and license revocation.Section 4.1: Critical Compliance ChecklistsTCPA & National DNC RegistryRefer to Table 2 (Section 1.3) for the full TCPA checklist.Agents must scrub all purchased lead lists against the National Do Not Call (DNC) registry at least every 31 days.27An "existing business relationship" or prior express written consent is the only safe harbor for contacting a number on the DNC list.31CMS Requirements (ACA & Medicare)ACA Documentation:Consumer Consent: Must be obtained before any assistance. Must document: Date, Consumer Name, and Agent/Agency Name.70Eligibility Attestation: Must be obtained before application submission. Must document: Date information was reviewed, Consumer Name, and Agent/Broker Name.70Retention: BOTH documents must be kept for a minimum of 10 years.70Medicare Marketing (Applies to MA & PDP):NO Unsolicited Contact: This includes a strict prohibition on door-to-door marketing, cold calling, unsolicited text messages, and leaving voicemail messages.23Call Recording: ALL "sales, marketing, and enrollment calls" must be recorded.5 This includes virtual calls (Zoom, FaceTime).Disclaimer: The following disclaimer must be stated within the first minute of the call: “We do not offer every plan available in your area. Currently, we represent [insert number of organizations] organizations which offer [insert number of plans] products in your area. Please contact Medicare.gov, 1-800-MEDICARE, or your local State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) to get information on all your options.” 5Retention: Call recordings must be stored for 10 years.5NAIC Best Interest & SEC Reg BIThese regulations formalize "suitability." The NAIC's Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation (#275) 82 is being adapted by states for life insurance, creating a "best interest" standard. This is a direct response to IUL lawsuits.74The NAIC model requires agents to satisfy four "obligations" 6:Care Obligation: Act in the consumer's best interest.Disclosure Obligation: Disclose your role and any conflicts of interest.Conflict of Interest Obligation: Mitigate conflicts.Documentation Obligation: Document in writing the justification for any recommendation, proving it was in the consumer's best interest.SEC Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) applies this same standard to broker-dealers and their associated persons when recommending securities.84Section 4.2: What NOT to Say: Avoiding MisrepresentationIUL/Whole Life Prohibited PhrasesThis is the single greatest legal threat to an IUL-focused agency. The marketing of IUL as a "risk-free" investment is the primary driver of lawsuits and regulatory action.74Table 7: IUL Misrepresentation "What NOT to Say" GuideMisleading Phrase / "Warning Sign"The Compliant Truth (What to Say Instead)"This is a tax-free retirement plan." 74"This policy allows for tax-deferred growth of the cash value. You can access this value through tax-free policy loans, but you must manage the loan balance to prevent a taxable event or policy lapse.""It's a 401(k) / Roth IRA alternative." 75"This is a life insurance policy, not an investment. Unlike a 401(k), the primary purpose is the death benefit. The cash value component is a feature of the policy that has different tax treatment and risks.""No downside market risk!" 74"The policy has a 0% floor, which means your cash value won't decrease due to market losses. However, your growth is also capped in strong market years, and policy costs and fees will still be deducted.""The policy will pay for itself." 75"Illustrations may project that policy values could cover future premiums, but this is not guaranteed. If the policy underperforms, you may need to pay more premiums out of pocket to prevent a lapse.""Outperform your 401(k)." 74"We cannot compare this to the S&P 500. Illustrations show hypothetical returns based on an index, but they don't include dividends, which are a major part of total market returns." 87Required Disclosures (All Products)Prior to any sales presentation, an agent must disclose:That they are acting as a life insurance agent.88The full name of the insurance company they are representing.88Documentation & Retention RequirementsAll sales materials, including telemarketing scripts, must be on file with the insurer and available for regulators.89ACA Records: 10 years.70Medicare Call Recordings: 10 years.5NAIC Suitability: Agents must document in writing the justification for any recommendation.6State-Specific Regulations: Agents must be aware of state-specific rules. For example, Kentucky provides a 10-day "free look" period, a 30-day grace period for premium payments, and a state guaranty fund limit of $300,000 for death benefits.90ConclusionSuccess in the 2024-2025 insurance market is not just about what is sold, but how it is sold and how it is documented. The sales strategies, scripts, and processes in this manual are designed to maximize efficiency in a high-cost, low-attention environment. However, their effectiveness is entirely contingent on the rigid, non-negotiable implementation of the compliance frameworks outlined.The agencies that integrate efficient multi-channel sales (Parts 1-2) with robust, auditable compliance systems (Parts 3-4) will be the only ones to achieve scalable, defensible growth. The era of the non-compliant "fast-talker" is over; the era of the "compliant operator" has begun.
