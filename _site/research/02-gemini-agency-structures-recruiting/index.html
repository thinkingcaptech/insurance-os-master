<h2>Top Recommendations</h2>
<h3>Agency structure &amp; design</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick a lane and align support/comp (career-builder vs. high-volume IMO); hybrid for balanced scale/support.</li>
<li>Centralize a “hub” (marketing, compliance, new business, tech) with pods/teams led by seniors.</li>
<li>Offer two comp tracks: advances for veterans; as-earned/training allowance for risk-averse quality recruits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recruiting strategies &amp; messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message “realistic opportunity” (hard first year, strong year-5 upside) to filter churn-prone candidates.</li>
<li>Target “unhappy pros,” veterans, proven salespeople; keep referral programmatic and rewarded.</li>
<li>Treat CPH as investment; solve cashflow with 3–6 month training allowance/forgivable draw.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Onboarding &amp; training</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enforce 30-day sprint with clear weekly KPIs (license, Project 100, role-play, 10 appointments).</li>
<li>Mandate daily huddles and scheduled role-play; use dedicated coaches (not top producers).</li>
<li>Day-one digital office: CRM + quoting + e-app; pay pre-licensing “scholarship.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retention &amp; compensation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tie bonuses to early activity (“fast start” in first 90 days); manage leading indicators, not just results.</li>
<li>Dual career path: manager (overrides) vs. top producer (higher street comp/equity/specialist bonuses).</li>
<li>Culture: public recognition of activities; strict compliance posture as recruiting/retention magnet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory (MLM/pyramid line, suitability/compliance): Tie overrides to real production; strong suitability review; compliance-first scripts and recorded training/comms.</li>
<li>Attrition (expectations, prospecting, cashflow): Realistic messaging; proven lead/process playbooks; training allowance/as-earned comp; intensive first 90-day coaching.</li>
<li>Cashflow/chargebacks: Offer as-earned or smaller advances to new agents; coach persistency; track 13-month persistency as a core KPI.</li>
<li>Reputational (get-rich-quick messaging): Remove “unlimited income” claims; publish realistic earnings paths; enforce culture over toxic top producers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future-Proofing (2025–2026 &amp; AI)</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Bionic” agent era: AI for resume/video screening (grit/coachability), 24/7 role-play and call analysis, auto-notes/CRM updates and form prefill.</li>
<li>Prep steps: adopt LMS with AI role-play/call QA; standardize scripts/KPIs; centralize data in CRM; universal call recording; build compliance logging into workflows.</li>
<li>Outcome: AI shortens time-to-competence (months → weeks) and lets managers coach strategy instead of admin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term (0–90 days)</strong>: Choose structure and publish comp/support policy; implement 30-day sprint playbook; assign dedicated coaches; daily huddles + role-play; launch realistic-opportunity recruiting and referral bonuses; pay pre-licensing scholarships; day-one stack enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Medium-term (6–12 months)</strong>: Roll out training allowance/forgivable draw and fast-start bonuses; deploy LMS + recorded best practices; pilot AI role-play/call analysis; formalize dual career paths; weekly 1:1s for &lt;1-year agents; manage leading indicators.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term (1–2 years)</strong>: Build/choose integrated hub platform (leads + CRM + quoting + e-app + analytics); institutionalize compliance culture as differentiator; expand specialized pods; continuously refine AI-assisted recruiting/training/QA to cut churn and ramp time.</li>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>The 2024-2025 Life Insurance Agency Playbook: Structures, Systems, and Strategies for Scalable GrowthPart 1: Agency Architecture: Modern Organizational and Compensation DesignThe structural, organizational, and financial architecture of a life insurance agency is its foundational blueprint. This architecture dictates its capacity for scale, its recruiting profile, its cultural identity, and its ultimate profitability. For the 2024-2025 landscape, the choice of model is no longer a simple binary between &quot;captive&quot; and &quot;independent,&quot; but a complex strategic decision involving trade-offs between control, speed, support, and technology.1.1 Analysis of Foundational Agency StructuresThe operational structure of an agency defines its lines of communication, hierarchy, and management responsibilities.Hierarchical ModelThis is the traditional &quot;career-builder&quot; model, famously employed by large, century-old mutual carriers. The structure is clear, multi-layered, and built for deep cultural indoctrination and managerial control.Structure: The organization flows from a central agency owner (often a General Agent or Managing Partner) down through a layer of Unit Managers (or Managing Directors), who in turn are responsible for recruiting, training, and managing a team of front-line agents.Analysis: The primary advantages of this model are its unparalleled strength in training and mentorship, high levels of compliance oversight, and strong brand and cultural control. New agents are typically brought into a physical office and put through a rigorous, long-term development program. The chief disadvantages are its high overhead costs (physical office space, manager salaries, comprehensive support staff) and its slow, linear scalability. It is difficult to &quot;blitz-scale&quot; a hierarchical model, as it can take 3-5 years to develop a new Unit Manager capable of building their own team.Flat OrganizationThe flat structure is common in small, virtual, or highly specialized boutique agencies. It prioritizes agility and low overhead over hierarchical depth.Structure: The agency owner, or a small leadership team, interacts directly with all agents. Agents may operate as pure &quot;lone wolves&quot; or in small, collaborative &quot;pods,&quot; but there is no formal middle-management layer.Analysis: This model's strengths are its agility, low cost, and speed of communication. It is highly effective for a small group of high-producing, self-sufficient veterans. However, its primary weakness is a severe limitation on &quot;span of control.&quot; A single agency owner can only effectively recruit, train, and support a small number of agents (typically 5-10) before becoming a bottleneck. This model lacks a defined career path for agents who wish to move into management, limiting its long-term retention of ambitious talent.Hybrid ModelThe hybrid model is emerging as the dominant and most effective structure for 2024-2025. It strategically combines the support and oversight of the hierarchical model with the low overhead and agility of a flat structure.Structure: The model features two core components:Agent &quot;Pods&quot;: Agents operate in small, semi-autonomous teams, often led by a senior producer or &quot;team lead&quot; who may earn a small override.Centralized &quot;Hub&quot;: Critical non-revenue-generating functions are centralized and shared across the entire agency. This hub provides shared services such as marketing and lead generation, compliance, new business processing, underwriting support, and technology management.Analysis: This structure is a direct solution to the trade-off between control and scalability. It allows for rapid, scalable growth (like a flat model) by adding new &quot;pods,&quot; while simultaneously providing the robust, professional support that agents need (like a hierarchical model). The viability of this model is almost entirely dependent on the agency's technology stack. In this structure, technology (CRM, marketing automation, e-application platforms) effectively replaces the administrative and reporting functions of the traditional Unit Manager. This shift allows human managers to divest themselves of administrative tracking and focus 100% on high-value activities: coaching, recruiting, and joint work.1.2 The Independent vs. Captive Agent EcosystemThe agency's structure is deeply intertwined with its relationship to the insurance carriers it represents.Captive AgentA captive agent represents a single carrier (e.g., State Farm, New York Life) and is restricted to selling that carrier's proprietary products.Analysis: In exchange for this exclusivity, the agent receives significant support. This often includes a physical office, a comprehensive (and often paid) training program, access to leads, and frequently a &quot;training allowance&quot; or forgivable draw to stabilize income in the first 1-2 years. The trade-off is a lower commission rate (e.g., 55-70% of first-year premium) and a product portfolio limited to one carrier. This model builds deep brand loyalty but can struggle to retain top producers who desire higher compensation and broader market access.Independent AgentAn independent agent is a non-exclusive contractor who can represent multiple carriers.Analysis: This agent is effectively an entrepreneur. They typically receive much higher commission rates (e.g., 90-140% of first-year premium) and can offer clients the &quot;best-fit&quot; product from dozens of carriers. However, they receive little to no support. They are responsible for 100% of their own leads, training, technology, and Errors &amp; Omissions (E&amp;O) insurance. This model attracts self-sufficient, entrepreneurial agents but is a brutal environment for the inexperienced.The IMO/FMO/MGA EcosystemThe support structure for the independent agent is provided by Independent Marketing Organizations (IMOs), Field Marketing Organizations (FMOs), or Managing General Agents (MGAs).Analysis: An IMO/FMO is a B2B wholesaler that holds high-level &quot;master&quot; contracts with dozens of insurance carriers. They provide aggregated value to independent agents. This includes:Carrier Access: A single point of contracting for 50+ carriers.Higher Commissions: The IMO's aggregated $100M+ in annual production allows them to negotiate a 125% contract, which they can then share with their agents (e.g., offering them 110%).Back-Office Support: Centralized support for new business, case design, and underwriting.Systems: Access to proprietary (or discounted) technology, marketing platforms, and lead programs.A Managing General Agent (MGA) is often a large agency or a &quot;downline&quot; hierarchy operating under the umbrella of a larger IMO/FMO, building their own team while leveraging the IMO's infrastructure.A significant market convergence is now occurring. To combat attrition, &quot;captive&quot; carriers are increasingly offering &quot;brokerage&quot; options (access to non-proprietary products) to their top agents. Simultaneously, &quot;independent&quot; IMOs are building proprietary technology platforms, high-touch support systems, and lead-generation programs that mimic the high-support captive model. The 2024-2025 battle will be won by the organization that offers the optimal blend of high commission and high support.This ecosystem also highlights a primary driver of agent attrition: recruiting mismatch. The #1 mistake agencies make is recruiting a &quot;captive&quot; personality (an individual needing structure, support, and a predictable paycheck) into an &quot;independent&quot; system (high commission, no support, 100% &quot;eat what you kill&quot;). This agent is systematically set up for failure, which directly correlates with &quot;unrealistic expectations&quot; being a top reason for leaving the industry.1.3 Specialized Analysis: Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) ModelsWithin the independent IMO/MGA space, the Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) model is a common and controversial structure. It is, at its core, a compensation and recruiting engine.Structure: This model features two primary compensation streams:Personal Production: High &quot;street level&quot; commissions (e.g., 100-145%) on policies the agent personally sells.Override Commissions: The agent receives a commission &quot;override&quot; (or &quot;spread&quot;) from the production of other agents they recruit into their &quot;downline&quot; hierarchy.Pros: This model offers unmatched speed of scalability and potential for exponential growth. It leverages the agent base to perform the recruiting function, allowing the agency to expand nationally at a very low cost, as agents typically pay for their own licensing, training, and leads.Cons: The model is characterized by extremely high agent churn (often exceeding 95% in the first year), significant reputational risk in the marketplace, and the potential for market saturation.Legal &amp; Regulatory ConsiderationsThe most critical component of this model is the legal and compliance framework. The legal line between a legitimate MLM structure (which is legal) and an illegal pyramid scheme (which is not) is fine but clear.The Litmus Test: Compensation must be driven primarily by the sale of products (policies) to end-users (clients). If the primary driver of revenue and overrides is recruiting itself (e.g., charging large fees for joining, paying &quot;headhunting&quot; bonuses not tied to production, or rewarding agents for purchasing products they do not need), the organization risks being classified as an illegal pyramid scheme by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or state Attorneys General.The Behavioral Flaw: The MLM model's core incentive structure is a behavioral engine. It uses the powerful promise of passive override income to motivate the action of mass recruiting. This can create a systemic flaw: the best theoretical way to make money in the system is often recruiting, not selling. This can disincentivize the core activity of serving clients and lead to a &quot;churn and burn&quot; culture.The 2024-2025 Regulatory Squeeze: In a post-pandemic, &quot;gig-economy&quot; world, regulators are hyper-focused on &quot;business opportunity&quot; claims that may target vulnerable populations. The &quot;unlimited income&quot; and &quot;be your own boss&quot; messaging frequently used by these models is a significant liability. The agencies that survive and thrive in this space (such as Family First Life, noted in) will be those that have built an entire compliance framework around proving that legitimate sales to non-agents are the sole source of all commissions. They must also shift their recruiting message from &quot;get rich quick&quot; to &quot;build a legitimate business.&quot;1.4 Compensation Architecture: Mapping Pay to PerformanceThe compensation structure is the financial engine that drives behavior at every level of the agency.Commission Structures by ProductThis is the &quot;street level&quot; commission paid to the writing agent, expressed as a percentage of the first-year annualized premium.Term/Whole Life: 90-140% (e.g., a policy with a $1,000 annual premium pays the agent $900 - $1,400).Indexed Universal Life (IUL): 80-120%.Annuities (Fixed Indexed): 6-10% (paid on the total lump sum deposit).Managerial OverridesThis is the primary financial incentive for managers and agency builders. An override is the difference (or &quot;spread&quot;) between the manager's commission contract and their agent's contract.Example: A manager (MGA) has a 110% contract with the IMO. They recruit a new agent and offer them a 90% contract. The MGA earns a 20% override (110% - 90% = 20%) on all business that agent writes. This model incentivizes the manager to recruit and actively train their agents to be successful.Advances &amp; ChargebacksThis is the industry's double-edged sword: a critical tool for new agent cash flow and the single greatest source of agent failure and debt.Advance: Because commissions are paid &quot;as-earned&quot; by the client (e.g., monthly), the carrier advances the agent a portion of the full-year commission immediately upon policy issue. This is typically 6-9 months of the first-year commission (e.g., 75% of a $1,000 commission, or $750, is paid day one).Chargeback: If the client cancels the policy within the first 12 months (a &quot;lapse&quot;), the carrier &quot;charges back&quot; the advanced, unearned portion of the commission. The agent must pay this $750 back to the carrier, often creating a sudden and debilitating debt.The advance/chargeback system is a primary driver of early agent failure. A new agent can receive $5,000 in advances, spend it on living expenses, and then face $3,000 in chargebacks from early lapses, forcing them into debt and out of the business. This system also incentivizes poor agent behavior (e.g., &quot;twisting&quot; policies, which creates lapses) and disincentivizes selling to lower-income clients, who statistically have lower policy persistency (i.e., they lapse more often).Vesting SchedulesVesting defines who owns the &quot;renewal&quot; commissions (commissions paid by the carrier in years 2-10+) if the agent leaves the agency.Captive/Hierarchical Model: These agencies often use 3, 5, or 10-year vesting schedules. If an agent leaves before they are &quot;100% vested,&quot; they forfeit all future renewal income. This is an extremely powerful retention tool, often referred to as the industry's &quot;golden handcuffs.&quot;Independent/IMO Model: In this space, &quot;100% immediate vesting&quot; is a primary recruiting tool. It means the agent owns their renewal income from day one. This is a key part of the &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; promise.Because the advance/chargeback system is so toxic to new agents, top-tier agencies are innovating around it. For 2024-2025, a key strategic advantage is offering two tracks: (1) The traditional Advance (for experienced, credit-worthy agents) and (2) a &quot;Training Allowance&quot; or a pure &quot;As-Earned&quot; commission model. The &quot;as-earned&quot; model provides slower, debt-free cash flow (the agent is only paid as the client pays), which de-risks the agent's first year. This attracts a higher quality, more financially stable candidate who is risk-averse—a direct counter to the &quot;unrealistic expectations&quot; that fuel attrition.Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Agency Organizational StructuresModelCore PhilosophyTypical CommissionTypical SupportScalabilityBest FitHierarchical (Captive)&quot;Build a Career&quot;Low (55-70%)Very High (Training, Office, Leads)Slow / LinearNew agents, &quot;Career-builder&quot; personalityFlat (Boutique)&quot;Elite Producers&quot;High (90-140%)Very Low (Self-sufficient)Low / CappedSmall group of virtual, veteran specialistsHybrid (Hub &amp; Spoke)&quot;Scalable Support&quot;High (90-120%)High (Centralized Tech &amp; Admin)High / RapidGrowth-focused MGAs, Virtual AgenciesMLM (IMO)&quot;Build an Empire&quot;Very High (100-145%)Low (Tech-based, Self-service)ExponentialMass-market, &quot;Business opportunity&quot; seekerPart 2: The Talent Acquisition Engine: 2024-2025 Recruiting SystemsA life insurance agency is a distribution business; therefore, its recruiting system is its primary engine for growth. A dysfunctional recruiting system leads to low-quality candidates, high churn, and stagnant growth. A high-performance system is a scalable, predictable machine for attracting, filtering, and securing top talent.2.1 Strategic Sourcing: Identifying and Attracting High-Potential CandidatesThe search for quality agents is a &quot;portfolio&quot; approach, balancing high-volume channels with high-quality sources.Where to Find AgentsReferrals: This remains the highest quality source. Successful agents know other successful, disciplined people. A structured, proactive referral program that rewards current agents for prospects (regardless of hire) is a cornerstone of sustainable growth.Job Boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter): This is the highest volume channel. It is effective for &quot;top-of-funnel&quot; brand awareness and attracting a large applicant pool. However, it also attracts &quot;job seekers&quot; rather than &quot;business builders,&quot; leading to lower conversion rates and lower retention.Niche Targets: The most successful agencies do not &quot;hire from the public&quot;; they target specific, proven profiles. These include:&quot;Unhappy&quot; Professionals: Teachers, restaurant/hospitality managers, and retail managers. These individuals are accustomed to long hours, have strong interpersonal skills, but are &quot;capped out&quot; in their current income.Military Veterans: Valued for their discipline, resilience, and coachability.Other Salespeople: Individuals from car sales, solar, or B2B software who have proven sales skills but are seeking a more permanent, high-income career with renewal-based income.Recruiting Messaging &amp; ScriptsThe messaging must shift from &quot;job&quot; to &quot;opportunity.&quot; Traditional scripts emphasize &quot;being your own boss&quot;, &quot;unlimited income&quot;, and &quot;building a business.&quot;This messaging, however, represents a significant liability. The data is clear: the #1 reason agents leave the industry is &quot;unrealistic expectations&quot;. The &quot;unlimited income&quot; script directly causes this problem. It attracts &quot;get rich quick&quot; candidates (a major red flag) and repels the stable, long-term builders the agency actually wants.The most successful agencies in 2024-2025 are shifting their messaging from &quot;unlimited opportunity&quot; to &quot;realistic opportunity.&quot;Old Message: &quot;Make six figures your first year, work from anywhere!&quot;New Message: &quot;This is the hardest-working, lowest-paying job you'll have for the first 12 months. Expect to work 50+ hours/week to make $50,000 in your first year. We will provide a proven path, but if you master it, you have the potential to earn $250,000 in year five.&quot;This transparent messaging reduces the total number of top-of-funnel applicants but dramatically increases the quality and retention of those who proceed.2.2 The Recruiting Funnel: Metrics, Costs, and Conversion BenchmarksRecruiting must be a data-driven process, not an emotional one.The Funnel StagesA typical, high-volume recruiting funnel follows a clear progression:Application: A candidate applies via a job board or referral.Initial Screen: Often an automated text/email screen or a 15-minute call with a recruiter.Manager Interview: A behavioral interview with the hiring manager.Second Interview: (Optional) A &quot;peer&quot; interview or a final &quot;vision&quot; interview with the agency owner.Contracting &amp; Background: The agent signs their contract and undergoes a background check.Pre-Licensing: The &quot;bottleneck&quot; stage where the agent must complete their education and pass the state exam.Licensed &amp; &quot;Ready to Sell&quot;: The agent is officially &quot;hired&quot; and can begin training.Funnel Conversion RatesThe conversion rates in a high-volume, commission-only funnel are brutal. A typical example looks like:100 Applicants (from Job Boards)25 Pass Initial Screen10 First Interviews Conducted5 Second Interviews Conducted3 Agents Contracted (Background check passed)1-2 Agents Pass Licensing Exam1 Agent is still active after 90 days.This 100-to-1 or 50-to-1 ratio is standard and underscores the necessity of a high-volume, &quot;always-on&quot; recruiting pipeline to generate even a handful of successful agents. It also reveals that the biggest drop-off is not in the interview process. It's the &quot;3 Contracted -&gt; 1-2 Pass Exam&quot; stage. This means the real bottleneck is the licensing process. The agency's job is not done when the agent signs the contract; it must have a structured onboarding system (see Part 3) to force these recruits over the licensing finish line.Recruiting Costs per AgentThe cost per hire (CPH) for a life insurance agent varies dramatically by model.CPH: $2,500 - $7,500. This includes job board fees, assessment tools, background checks, and the (often un-tracked) cost of the manager's time.Most agencies view this $7,500 CPH as an expense to be minimized. This is a catastrophic strategic error. Successful agencies view CPH as an investment to be optimized. They understand that the &quot;Cost of Failure&quot; is the real metric.Cost of Failure = CPH ($7,500) + Wasted Training &amp; Support ($5,000+) = $12,500+This $12,500+ is the true cost for every agent who fails in the first 6-12 months. Therefore, a successful agency is willing to increase its CPH (e.g., to $10,000) by offering a signing bonus or a training allowance to attract a proven, high-quality candidate, because they know that minimizing the Cost of Failure is the real path to profitability.2.3 Assessment and Selection: Identifying Top PerformersSince the &quot;Cost of Failure&quot; is so high, the selection process is paramount. Its goal is to filter for the traits that actually predict success.Interview ProcessThe interview process must be multi-stage and behavioral. The goal is not to assess &quot;sales skill&quot; (which can be taught) but to assess two core traits: Grit and Coachability.Behavioral Questions: &quot;Tell me about a time you worked for 6 months on a project that ultimately failed. What did you do next?&quot; (Assesses resilience). &quot;Tell me about your most difficult client and how you handled them.&quot; (Assessesproblem-solving).Assessment ToolsPsychometric and behavioral assessments like the Predictive Index (PI), DISC, or Caliper are critical.Analysis: These tools are not for hiring or firing. They are for identifying an agent's core drives and &quot;fingerprint.&quot; The ideal life insurance profile is typically a High Drive (ambition, money-motivated), High Influence (persuasive, outgoing), and, most importantly, High Resilience/Grit. The job is 90% rejection; a &quot;skilled&quot; salesperson who lacks grit will wash out faster than an &quot;unskilled&quot; but gritty candidate. The skill of selling insurance can be taught. The trait of resilience cannot.Red Flags&quot;Get rich quick&quot; mentality: The candidate is only asking about commission splits and &quot;how fast&quot; they can make money.Blaming past employers: A pattern of &quot;my old boss was bad,&quot; &quot;the leads were bad,&quot; etc. This shows a lack of accountability.&quot;Commission-only as a last resort&quot;: They are desperate and need a paycheck now.Poor personal finances: This is not just about stability; it is a critical compliance and reputational filter. An agent in financial distress is desperate. They are far more likely to &quot;churn&quot; policies (illegally replacing old ones for a new commission), sell unsuitable products (e.g., a massive annuity for a quick payout), or commit outright fraud. Hiring this agent directly imports legal and financial liability into the agency.What to AvoidThe two most toxic hires for an agency are:The &quot;Uncoachable Expert&quot;: A high-performer from another industry (e.g., a &quot;million-dollar&quot; real estate agent) who refuses to follow the agency's proven system. They are toxic to the culture and will fail, but only after wasting months of management time.The &quot;Unmotivated&quot;: A very nice, likeable person who is a great &quot;culture fit&quot; but lacks the internal drive to prospect. They will attend every training but never make a call.Table 2: Recruiting Channel Effectiveness &amp; Cost (2024)ChannelAvg.

Requires proactive messaging.Part 3: From Recruit to Producer: Optimizing Agent Onboarding and ActivationAn agency can have a world-class recruiting system and still fail if its onboarding process is broken. The &quot;handoff&quot; from &quot;recruit&quot; to &quot;active agent&quot; is the most dangerous part of the agent lifecycle. A structured onboarding process is not &quot;training&quot;; it is a psychological and tactical sprint designed to create momentum and secure a &quot;first win.&quot;3.1 The First 30-Day BlueprintThe first 30 days must be a structured sprint, broken into clear, non-negotiable weekly goals.Week 1: Licensing &amp; Contracting.Objective: Pass the state exam.Actions: The agent is only allowed to do one thing: study for their exam. Agency provides the pre-licensing &quot;scholarship&quot;. All contracting and background checks are completed in parallel. The goal is to pass the exam within 7-10 days.Week 2: Tech Setup &amp; Foundational Training.Objective: Learn the &quot;mechanics&quot; of the job.Actions: Get full access to the technology stack (CRM, quoting tools). Complete all mandatory compliance training (AML, E&amp;O). Begin &quot;Project 100&quot;: building their &quot;warm market&quot; list of their first 100 contacts.Week 3: Sales Process &amp; Role-Play.Objective: Master the agency's core scripts.Actions: Learn the &quot;2-minute introduction&quot; and the agency's standardized sales presentation. This week is 80% role-play with their manager, practicing the script to mastery.Week 4: &quot;Go Live.&quot;Objective: Secure the &quot;first win.&quot;Actions: Begin prospecting their &quot;Project 100&quot; list. The goal is not to &quot;make a sale,&quot; but to &quot;set 10 appointments.&quot; This is a KPI (Key Performance Indicator). This week requires heavy manager supervision and daily check-ins.The philosophy of this 30-day plan is Momentum, Not Mastery. It is not designed to create an insurance expert. It is designed to create velocity. A recruit who takes 60 days to get licensed has an infinitesimally small chance of success compared to one who does it in 10 days. The speed of the onboarding process is more important than the content in the early days.Furthermore, the real goal of this blueprint is psychological. It is about getting the agent their first win (passing the exam), their first feeling of belonging (team integration, daily check-ins), and their first business plan (Project 100). These &quot;soft&quot; wins are what bridge the psychological gap between the &quot;hire&quot; and the first (often delayed) commission check.3.2 Navigating the Regulatory LandscapeOnboarding is heavily front-loaded with regulatory and compliance hurdles.Licensing Requirements: Varies by state, but all require a &quot;Life &amp; Health&quot; (or similar) license. This typically involves 20-40 hours of mandatory pre-licensing education, followed by a proctored state exam.Pre-licensing Programs: Agencies partner with providers like A.D. Banker, Kaplan, or ExamFX. The cost is typically $100-$300. A critical &quot;best practice&quot; is the &quot;Onboarding Scholarship&quot;: the agency pays for this course (often via a 100% discount code). This small $100-$300 investment removes the first point of friction for a new recruit and builds immediate loyalty.Compliance Training: This is post-licensing and mandatory. The agency must ensure every agent completes:E&amp;O Insurance: Errors &amp; Omissions insurance must be secured.AML Training: Anti-Money Laundering training (mandatory, annual).Suitability &amp; Reg BI: Carrier-specific and general training on product suitability, especially for annuities and complex products.Most agencies view this compliance as a &quot;cost center&quot; or a &quot;necessary evil.&quot; This is a missed opportunity. For 2024-2025, successful agencies are weaponizing their compliance culture as a recruiting and retention tool. Experienced, high-quality agents are terrified of losing their license (and their livelihood) due to a rogue agent's mistake at their agency. By promoting its &quot;culture of compliance,&quot; &quot;rigid&quot; suitability review, and &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policy, an agency attracts these top producers, who see the agency as a safe harbor for their business.3.3 Day One Readiness: Technology StacksThe new agent must have their &quot;digital office&quot; set up on Day One. The core stack is non-negotiable.CRM (Customer Relationship Manager): This is the agent's &quot;brain.&quot; AgencyBloc, Salesforce, or a proprietary system (as seen in). It must track leads, clients, and policies.Quoting Tools: iPipeline, Compulife, or direct carrier portals.E-Application Platforms: Tools to submit applications digitally.The integration of this stack is far more important than the features of any single component. An agent who has to log into four different systems to run a quote, find a product, and submit an application will be less productive. The most successful IMOs (like FFL) have built their entire value proposition around a single, proprietary, all-in-one platform that integrates leads, CRM, e-app, and quoting. This frictionless platform is their #1 recruiting and retention tool.3.4 Support Systems: Mentorship and Buddy SystemsNo agent succeeds alone. A support system is critical, but it must be structured correctly.&quot;Buddy&quot; System: A peer (e.g., another agent who is 6-12 months into the business). This is for camaraderie and basic, &quot;dumb&quot; questions (e.g., &quot;How do I find this form?&quot;).Mentorship Program: A structured relationship with a senior producer or manager.This is where most agencies fail. The most common mentorship failure is assigning a new agent to be &quot;mentored&quot; by a top producer. This always fails, for two reasons:The Time Mismatch: The top producer is too busy selling to dedicate real time to a new agent.The &quot;Unconscious Competence&quot; Mismatch: The top producer is so good at what they do, their skills are unconscious and intuitive. They cannot teach what they do automatically.The successful model is the Dedicated Coach Model. This person is not a top producer. They are a 3-5 year veteran who excels at teaching the system. Their primary compensation is not from their personal sales, but from overrides on their new agents' success. This perfectly aligns their financial incentives directly with the new agent's development.Table 3: Phased 30-Day Agent Onboarding PlanPhaseWeek 1: LicensingWeek 2: FoundationsWeek 3: Sales ProcessWeek 4: &quot;Go Live&quot;Key ObjectivePass the State ExamBuild &quot;Digital Office&quot; &amp; Prospect ListMaster the Agency ScriptSet 10 &quot;Warm Market&quot; AppointmentsAction ItemsComplete 40-hr pre-licensing course&quot;Scholarship&quot; paid by agencyGet logins for all techBuild &quot;Project 100&quot; contact listCompliance CheckState Exam ScheduledSubmit Contracting &amp; Background CheckE&amp;O Insurance BoundAML Training CompleteManager SupportDaily 5-min text check-inDaily 15-min &quot;progress&quot; check-inDaily 30-min Role-PlayDaily 30-min &quot;Huddle&quot; (review calls, plan next)Part 4: Building Mastery: Advanced Training and Development ProtocolsOnboarding (Part 3) is about momentum. Training is about mastery. A successful training and development program is not a single &quot;bootcamp&quot;; it is a continuous, career-long cadence of skill refinement.4.1 Foundational Training Programs (Post-Licensing)Once an agent is licensed, they immediately enter a 1-2 week &quot;bootcamp&quot; or &quot;Foundational Training&quot;.Length &amp; Content: This program must follow the 80/20 rule:20% Product Knowledge: The &quot;what.&quot; Basics of Term, Whole Life, IUL.80% Sales Process: The &quot;how-to.&quot; This is the most critical part and includes:Prospecting (how to find people)CRM Management (how to track them)The Sales Presentation (what to say)Objection Handling (what to say next)Delivery: A hybrid model is most effective. Virtual/LMS (see 4.4) is used for &quot;at-your-own-pace&quot; product knowledge. In-person/Live Virtual sessions are used for the interactive role-play of the sales process.A massive strategic shift has occurred. Ten years ago, training was 80% product (e.g., &quot;Here are the 27 features of our new IUL&quot;). Today, products are commoditized. Successful 2024-2025 training is 80% process (e.g., &quot;Here is exactly how to get an appointment from a LinkedIn connection&quot;). Agencies that still lead with product-heavy training are failing their new agents.4.2 Continuous Development and Role-PlayThe &quot;bootcamp&quot; is just the beginning. The real training happens in the continuous cadence of the agency.Daily: 15-minute &quot;Huddle&quot; (virtual or in-person). Purpose: Celebrate wins from yesterday, set one specific activity goal for today (e.g., &quot;My goal is 3 conversations&quot;).Weekly: 60-minute &quot;Team Training.&quot; Purpose: A deep-dive skill workshop (e.g., handling the &quot;I need to think about it&quot; objection, a new prospecting script).Monthly: 2-hour &quot;Advanced Workshop&quot; or &quot;Case Study Review.&quot; Purpose: Review a complex (or failed) case as a team.Role-Play SystemsRole-play is the most critical training element, and the one most resisted by agents and managers. It cannot be &quot;optional&quot; or &quot;when we have time.&quot; It must be a scheduled, non-negotiable part of the weekly training cadence.Role-play is the only leading indicator for an agent's skill. Managers often struggle to diagnose problems. An agent says, &quot;I made 100 calls and got 0 appointments.&quot; The manager doesn't know why. Is the script bad? Is the agent's delivery bad? Is their tone wrong? Scheduled role-play is the diagnostic tool. When the manager hears the agent's &quot;live&quot; script in a practice setting, the problem becomes instantly obvious. Agencies that fail at role-play (because &quot;it's awkward&quot; or &quot;agents don't like it&quot;) cannot diagnose or coach (see 5.3) effectively.4.3 Advanced Training for Top PerformersAgents (especially top performers) leave when they hit a ceiling and get bored. Advanced training is a retention strategy.Certification Programs: The agency should sponsor and support agents in pursuing advanced designations, such as the CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter) or ChFC (Chartered Financial Consultant).Advanced Training: For elite performers (e.g., MDRT qualifiers), this includes &quot;Mastermind&quot; groups, access to high-net-worth specialists (e.g., estate planning attorneys), and reward/training trips.This advanced training serves a dual purpose.Retention: It gives a top producer a &quot;new mountain to climb,&quot; preventing them from being poached by a competitor.Marketing: The &quot;CLU&quot; designation gives the agent credibility to move upmarket—from selling $100/month term policies to middle-income families, to designing $1M estate plans for business owners. This dramatically increases their average premium and the agency's revenue.4.4 The Ed-Tech StackModern training is delivered through a sophisticated &quot;Ed-Tech&quot; stack.LMS (Learning Management System): This is a &quot;Netflix for training.&quot; It is an on-demand, virtual library of all agency scripts, product guides, compliance documents, and—most importantly—recordings of the best producers giving the sales presentation. This democratizes training, allowing a new agent to &quot;ride along&quot; with a top producer 100 times, on demand.AI-Driven Tools: This is the 2024-2025 game-changer. Emerging tech platforms now offer:AI-Powered Role-Play: Simulates objections and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios, allowing an agent to practice.AI Call-Analysis: Reviews recordings of an agent's sales calls and provides feedback (e.g., &quot;You used 'um' 14 times,&quot; &quot;You spoke for 80% of the call,&quot; &quot;You missed a buying signal here.&quot;).This AI technology solves the biggest barrier to role-play: agent awkwardness and manager scheduling. An AI provides a 24/7, non-judgmental practice partner. An agent can practice their script 50 times in private before the live session. This technology will dramatically shorten the &quot;time-to-competence&quot; for new agents. The agencies that adopt this technology first will create an unassailable competitive advantage in training.Part 5: The Human Capital Strategy: Compensation, Retention, and PerformanceThis section synthesizes the economic, cultural, and managerial systems required to keep and grow the talent that the agency worked so hard to recruit and train.5.1 The Economic Model: Compensation (Revisited)The compensation model is the agent's primary &quot;economic relationship&quot; with the agency.Base Salary vs. Commission-OnlyThis is the foundational economic choice.Commission-Only: Attracts entrepreneurs but has massive 90-day attrition (as noted in). It is highly scalable, as the agency has no fixed payroll cost.Base Salary: Attracts employees (not entrepreneurs), provides stability, but is not scalable and caps agent income.The 2024-2025 Solution: The &quot;Training Allowance&quot;The most effective model is a hybrid: the &quot;Training Allowance&quot; (TA) or &quot;Forgivable Draw.&quot;How it works: The agency provides a modest stipend (e.g., $500/week for the first 3-6 months) in addition to commissions. This $2,000/month is often structured as a &quot;draw,&quot; meaning it's an advance against future commissions.Why it works: This model de-risks the new agent's cash flow, directly solving one of the top 3 reasons for attrition (&quot;Poor Cash Flow&quot;).Strategic Impact: This is a recruiting weapon. An agency offering a $2,000/month TA will decimate its &quot;commission-only&quot; competitors in the recruiting market. It attracts the high-quality, risk-averse &quot;unhappy professional&quot; (e.g., the teacher, the veteran) who cannot afford to go 3 months without a paycheck. This requires the agency to be well-capitalized, but it transforms the quality of their recruits.Bonus and Incentive ProgramsBonuses must be tied to activity and near-term results.&quot;Fast Start&quot; Bonus: This is the most effective program. (e.g., &quot;Place $5,000 in premium in your first 90 days, get a $2,500 cash bonus&quot;). This aligns with the 30-day plan, funds the agent's success, and provides a powerful psychological win.5.2 The Attrition Crisis: Retention StrategiesRetention is the &quot;leaky bucket&quot; of the industry. Solving it is more profitable than recruiting.Why Agents LeaveThe top 3 reasons for attrition are all solvable:Unrealistic Expectations: Caused by &quot;unlimited income&quot; recruiting scripts. Solution: &quot;Realistic opportunity&quot; messaging.Difficulty Prospecting / Lead Generation: Caused by a lack of a clear system. Solution: A proven sales process (Part 4) and agency-supported lead programs.Poor Cash Flow / Income Instability: Caused by the commission-only/chargeback model. Solution: A &quot;Training Allowance&quot; or &quot;As-Earned&quot; model.Retention Rate BenchmarksThe industry data is abysmal.Year 1: 50% failure rate.Year 5: 80-90% failure rate.A &quot;Good&quot; Agency: 30% retention after 3 years.This data proves that recruiting must be a constant, non-negotiable business function, simply to replace those who will inevitably leave.Culture-Building StrategiesCulture is not &quot;ping pong tables&quot;. It is a shared mission and public recognition. A culture of accountability (see 5.3) and recognition (see below) is the #1 retention tool. It creates a &quot;tribe&quot; that agents are emotionally and financially invested in.Recognition and Reward SystemsThis is the most cost-effective retention tool. Recognition must be:Public: In front of peers (e.g., in the Daily Huddle).Weekly (or Daily): Not quarterly.Tied to Activity, Not Just Results: The daily huddle celebrating an agent who &quot;set 3 appointments&quot; (an activity) is more powerful for retention than a quarterly sales bonus (a result).Career Path DevelopmentThis is the most critical retention strategy for top agents. Agents leave when they hit a ceiling. The single worst business decision is promoting your best producer to manager. This fails because:You lose your best producer (their sales go to 0).You gain a bad manager (who hates admin and loves selling).The solution is the &quot;Dual Career Path&quot;. The agency must create two parallel paths of equal prestige and income:Path 1: The Manager: &quot;Empire Builder.&quot; Income comes from overrides and recruiting.Path 2: The &quot;Top Producer&quot; / Specialist: &quot;Master of the Craft.&quot; Income comes from higher personal commission contracts (e.g., 140%+), equity in the agency, and &quot;specialist&quot; bonuses.This path allows your best producer to keep producing and mentor (as a &quot;specialist&quot;) without the burden of managing. This retains that producer and allows them to elevate the team.Work-Life Balance InitiativesIn the 2024-2025 &quot;remote-first&quot; world, this means flexibility. It means trusting agents to work where and when they want, but holding them accountable for results (see 5.3) via the CRM and the daily huddle cadence.5.3 Performance ManagementPerformance management is the system of accountability that powers the culture.KPIs and Metrics to TrackThis is the most common failure point for managers. They must separate Leading Indicators (Effort) from Lagging Indicators (Results).Leading Indicators (Effort): You can control these. Dials, Conversations, Appointments Set, Social Media Posts, Referrals Asked For.Lagging Indicators (Results): You cannot control these. Applications Submitted, Policies Placed, First-Year Premium, Persistency.A bad manager asks, &quot;Why didn't you sell anything last week?&quot; (Lagging). This is demotivating and un-coachable.A good coach (see 5.3.2) asks, &quot;Your goal was 50 dials, and you made 50 dials. Great. You set 3 appointments, but they didn't 'sit.' Let's role-play your confirmation script.&quot; (Leading).The entire performance system must be re-oriented to manage effort and coach skill. The results will follow.Performance Review SystemsThe formal &quot;review&quot; should have a clear cadence:New Agents (&lt;1 Year): Weekly 1-on-1, 30 minutes.Veteran Agents: Monthly 1-on-1, 60 minutes.This review must be 90% forward-looking (coaching) and 10% backward-looking (reporting).Coaching and Accountability StructuresThis is the manager's #1 job. It is not a &quot;review.&quot;A review asks, &quot;What happened?&quot;A coaching session asks, &quot;What are we going to do next week to hit your goal?&quot;Coaching is skill-based (using role-play) and accountability-based (reviewing the Leading KPIs).Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)A PIP is a formal 30-day plan to correct course. A PIP must be tied only to Leading Indicators (Effort).Invalid PIP: &quot;You must sell $5,000 in premium in 30 days.&quot; (Lagging).Valid PIP: &quot;You must make 50 dials per day, have 5 conversations, and set 2 appointments per day, for 30 days.&quot; (Leading).If an agent cannot or will not do the activity (effort), they cannot remain.When and How to TerminateFire Fast for: Ethical/compliance breaches (S_S54) or negative cultural impact (e.g., the &quot;Uncoachable Expert&quot;).Fire Slow for: Production issues (if the effort is there, it's a coaching problem, not an agent problem).Fire Fast for: Lack of effort. If an agent on a PIP will not do the activity, they are terminated for cause.A &quot;toxic top producer&quot; (the uncoachable, non-compliant high-performer) is a cancer on the culture. Keeping them signals to the entire agency that money matters more than values. Firing them—and publicly (though professionally) stating why (&quot;they were not a fit for our culture of compliance and teamwork&quot;)—is the most powerful positive retention move a manager can make. It proves the culture is real.Table 4: Agency Performance Management: A Balanced ScorecardKPI CategoryKPI (Metric)Benchmark (Minimum)Target (Excellent)Recruiting (Top of Funnel)Cost-per-Hire (CPH)&lt; $7,500&lt; $5,000Onboarding (Activation)30-Day Exam Pass Rate60%85%New Agent (&lt;90 Days)Appointments Set / Week35+New Agent (&lt;90 Days)Applications Submitted / Week12+Veteran Agent (&gt;1 Year)Placed Premium / Month$8,000$15,000+Veteran Agent (&gt;1 Year)Referrals Asked For / Week1020+Agency Health13-Month Persistency (Anti-Lapse)85%92%+Agency Health1-Year Agent Retention Rate15%30%+Part 6: Case Studies in Excellence: Models from Top-Performing AgenciesThere is no single &quot;best&quot; model. Success is achieved when an agency's structure, recruiting, and compensation are perfectly aligned to execute its core strategy. The following case studies illustrate this principle.6.1 Case Study 1: The &quot;Career Builder&quot; Agency (e.g., Northwestern Mutual, New York Life)Model: Hierarchical, Captive.Systems:Recruiting: High-investment, high-friction. They recruit heavily from university campuses and &quot;career-changer&quot; programs. The hiring process is slow and multi-stage. The message is &quot;build a career,&quot; not &quot;get a job.&quot; CPH is very high.Training: Extremely deep, long-term, and resource-intensive. New agents are put through months of training on financial planning, product, and process. The focus is on mastery and achieving designations (CLU, ChFC).Compensation: Lower commission rates (e.g., 55-70%), offset by high bonuses, stipends, and a strong long-term vesting schedule that acts as &quot;golden handcuffs.&quot;What Makes Them Successful: Culture and Agent Selection. They invest $50,000+ into a new recruit and enforce a strong, professional, &quot;Top 100&quot;-style culture. Their model is not built to be fast. It is built to last, creating highly trained, highly loyal, and highly productive agents who stay for decades.6.2 Case Study 2: The &quot;High-Volume&quot; IMO (e.g., Family First Life, Equis)Model: Flat/MLM, Independent.Systems:Recruiting: High-volume, low-friction. The message is &quot;business opportunity&quot;. They hire fast (often in 1-2 interviews) and at massive scale, leveraging their agent force to recruit. CPH is very low.Training: 100% virtual, self-service, and system-based. Training is delivered via an LMS and weekly calls, focusing on a &quot;plug-and-play&quot; model: &quot;Buy these leads, use this script, get this result.&quot;Compensation: Extremely high &quot;street&quot; commission (100-145%), powerful overrides for building a downline, and 100% immediate vesting as a core recruiting tool.What Makes Them Successful: Scalability and Technology. Their &quot;product&quot; is not insurance; it is their proprietary technology platform. This platform solves all agent friction: it integrates lead purchasing, a simple CRM, e-application, and multi-carrier quoting all in one place. Their model is not built to last (at the individual agent level; churn is &gt;90%). It is built to be fast, scalable, and to win the recruiting war with a &quot;high commission, 100% vesting, great tech&quot; message.6.3 Case Study 3: The &quot;Specialized Virtual&quot; AgencyModel: Flat, 100% virtual, and niche-focused (e.g., specialists in federal employee benefits, high-net-worth estate planning, or &quot;Final Expense&quot; tele-sales).Systems:Recruiting: Digital-first. They do not &quot;build&quot; agents; they attract existing, experienced agents via social media, podcasts, and niche marketing. The message is, &quot;You're already a specialist; come to our platform for specialists.&quot;Training: Peer-to-peer masterminds. Training is about &quot;sharing what works&quot; at an elite level, not &quot;bootcamps.&quot;Compensation: Hybrid. Strong commission, profit-sharing, or equity.What Makes Them Successful: Low Overhead and Specialization. They dominate a specific niche through expert digital marketing and intellectual property, not a massive sales force. They attract proven talent; they do not build it.6.4 Synthesis: Common Denominators of SuccessThe case studies prove there is no single &quot;best&quot; model. The &quot;Career Builder&quot; and &quot;High-Volume IMO&quot; are diametrically opposed in every philosophy and system (e.g., low commission/high vesting vs. high commission/no vesting), yet both are billion-dollar enterprises.Success is not the model. Success is systemic alignment.NWM Alignment: Captive model -&gt; High Support -&gt; Low Commission -&gt; Long Vesting -&gt; Strict Culture = A culturally-driven retention model.FFL Alignment: IMO model -&gt; Low Support -&gt; High Commission -&gt; Immediate Vesting + Superior Tech = An opportunity-driven scalability model.Agency Failure is Systemic Misalignment. For example:An agency that demands &quot;captive&quot; exclusivity and offers low commissions... but also provides no training or leads (like an IMO).An IMO that promises &quot;high commissions&quot;... but also has a clunky tech stack and hidden fees.The 2024-2025 winner will be the agency with the least amount of friction between its structural promise and its operational reality.Part 7: Strategic Recommendations and 2025-2026 OutlookBased on this comprehensive analysis, the following strategic recommendations are presented for any agency owner, MGA, or carrier executive seeking to build a scalable, profitable, and durable life insurance distribution system for 2024-2026.7.1 Actionable Blueprint for Agency Structure SelectionRecommendation: Choose a model (Part 1) and commit. Stop straddling the fence. The &quot;misaligned&quot; agency is the first to fail.If you are a high-support &quot;Career Builder&quot;, you must invest the capital. This means paying for a &quot;Training Allowance&quot;, funding physical offices, and paying dedicated coaches.If you are a &quot;High-Volume&quot; IMO, you must invest in your technology. Your entire value proposition rests on creating a frictionless, all-in-one platform for agents.7.2 Recommendations for Building a Cost-Effective, Scalable Recruiting PipelineRecommendation: Win the &quot;War for Talent&quot; by Solving the Agent's Cash Flow Problem. Implement a 3-6 month &quot;Training Allowance&quot; (TA) or a forgivable draw. This de-risks the career change for the high-quality, risk-averse &quot;unhappy professionals&quot; (teachers, managers, veterans) who are your ideal recruits. This single-move will decimate your &quot;commission-only&quot; competitors' recruiting funnels.Recommendation: Shift your recruiting messaging from &quot;unlimited income&quot; to &quot;realistic opportunity.&quot; This will reduce top-of-funnel quantity but drastically increase candidate quality, reduce &quot;unrealistic expectations&quot;, and improve 1-year retention.7.3 Recommendations for Training and RetentionRecommendation: Shift 100% of your performance management to Leading Indicators. Manage activity, coach skill. Your managers' new mantra is, &quot;I don't care what you sold; I care what you did. Let's review your 50 dials.&quot;Recommendation: Build and evangelize the Dual Career Path. Publicly celebrate and pay your &quot;Top Producers&quot; (who stay producers) more than your new managers. This is the only way to stop your best producers from leaving for a &quot;better deal&quot; and solves the catastrophic &quot;promote-to-failure&quot; problem.Recommendation: Make role-play a mandatory, daily part of your &quot;under 90-day&quot; agent onboarding and a weekly part of your team training. This is the only way to diagnose and improve agent skill.7.4 Future-Proofing: The 2025-2026 OutlookOutlook: The &quot;Bionic&quot; Agent. The single biggest shift in the next 24 months will be the integration of Generative AI into the agency stack.AI in Recruiting: Will scan 1,000 resumes, conduct automated video pre-interviews, and screen for behavioral traits like resilience.AI in Training: Will provide 24/7 role-play and call analysis, slashing the &quot;time-to-competence&quot; from 6 months to 6 weeks.AI in Operations: Will handle all non-revenue-generating tasks: summarizing client meetings, updating the CRM, and pre-filling applications.Final Strategic Conclusion: AI will not replace life insurance agents. The empathy and trust required for a complex sale cannot be automated. Instead, AI will replace bad managers (by automating reporting) and replace bad agents (who are inefficient). It will supercharge the agents who use it, freeing them to focus 100% of their time on high-empathy, high-value client conversations. The agency that masters the integration of AI into its tech and training platforms will have an unassailable structural, training, and cost advantage.</p>
