<h1>Compliance &amp; Regulations (2025 Guide)</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory convergence: FCC TCPA one-to-one consent, FTC/TSR, DOL fiduciary rule, NAIC Best Interest, NAIC Data Security (#668); federal oversight bypassing McCarran-Ferguson via marketing/telecom/financial advice angles.</li>
<li>Telemarketing risk spike: One-to-one consent (Jan 27, 2025), “reasonable manner” opt-out (Apr 11, 2025), vicarious liability (Hossfeld); shared/aggregator/aged leads now high-liability.</li>
<li>Dual-standard transactions: DOL fiduciary (rollover advice) vs NAIC Best Interest (annuity sale); must apply the stricter (DOL) standard for rollover-triggered cases.</li>
<li>Licensing trend: Easier pre-licensing in some states vs. stricter product-specific CE (CA 2025: annuity BI, LTC, 4-hr life policy, 2-hr variable life; FL/TX ongoing requirements); track product-level qualifications, not just hours.</li>
<li>Data/privacy: NAIC Data Security (#668), GLBA safeguards, HIPAA for PHI, 10-year call recording (Medicare/ACA), state privacy (e.g., CA).</li>
<li>Core mandate: Provable, systemic compliance—not ad hoc. Centralized consent, DNC, CE tracking, call recording, documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Compliance Domains &amp; Actions</h2>
<h3>Licensing &amp; CE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Track entity + producer licenses across states; use NIPR/Sircon/AgentSync.</li>
<li>Monitor product-specific CE (annuity BI, LTC, CA life policy, variable life) and deadlines; do not rely on self-report.</li>
<li>Address low pass rates in some demos (e.g., TX Spanish exam 27%) with tailored prep if targeting multilingual teams.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TCPA / Telemarketing (High Risk)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-to-one consent (Jan 27, 2025): consent must name your agency; aggregator/shared leads non-compliant.</li>
<li>Reasonable-manner opt-out (Apr 11, 2025): honor opt-outs from any channel within 10 business days; central Internal DNC; propagate across all systems.</li>
<li>Vicarious liability (Hossfeld): liable for vendors/subcontractors’ violations; audit/terminate non-compliant lead sources.</li>
<li>Controls: DNC scrubbing (national/state/internal), time-zone enforcement (8a–9p), consent logs (disclosure, timestamp, IP, named seller) retained 4+ years, call recording.</li>
</ul>
<h3>State Insurance (NAIC Best Interest #275, Replacements, Senior Protections)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Best Interest: care, disclosure (role/non-fiduciary, compensation, conflicts), conflict management, documentation signed and retained.</li>
<li>Replacements: full disclosure of surrender/costs; carrier/agent forms; strict anti-twisting; high exam focus.</li>
<li>Seniors: avoid misleading designations; adhere to unfair trade practices; senior-specific training (e.g., CA 4-hr).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Federal Oversight (DOL, SEC/FINRA, AML, GLBA)</h3>
<ul>
<li>DOL fiduciary rule (2024): rollover advice = fiduciary; commissions need PTE (2020-02 or 84-24). Create “Retirement Asset” trigger → dual workflow (DOL fiduciary + NAIC BI).</li>
<li>SEC/FINRA (variable products): reps need Series licensing; FINRA 2210 applies to all comms; social media “adoption” rules (liking/sharing = adoption).</li>
<li>AML: insurer-owned program; agents follow carrier’s AML; covered products = cash value/annuity; expect SAR/CTR training.</li>
<li>GLBA/Data Security: follow NAIC #668; written info security program, vendor oversight, incident response, least-privilege access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advertising/Marketing</h3>
<ul>
<li>No misleading plan names, guarantees, or unapproved testimonials; FTC testimonial rules in effect; income claims need substantiation &amp; disclaimers.</li>
<li>HEC/Special Ads rules (FB/Google): no demographic targeting; accurate disclosures.</li>
<li>MA/PDP: no unsolicited D2D; CMS-required disclaimers; record all sales/marketing calls/virtual meetings 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sales Process &amp; Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Required disclosures: role, compensation, conflicts, non-fiduciary (state); fiduciary acknowledgment (DOL rollover); product illustrations and signed “why” documentation.</li>
<li>Recording: Medicare/ACA/MA-PDP all marketing/sales calls and virtual meetings for 10 years.</li>
<li>Application/replacements: proper forms, signatures, and retention; avoid unapproved scripts/claims.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Privacy &amp; Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement NAIC #668-style safeguards: risk assessment, written ISP, encryption where feasible, MFA, audit logs, vendor DPAs, breach notification plan.</li>
<li>HIPAA: PHI handling; e-sign and texting with BAA (DocuSign/SignNow, compliant texting platforms).</li>
<li>Internal access controls: least privilege; secure document management; client portal vs. email for sensitive info.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TCPA/TSR fines</strong> ($500–$1,500 per call/text; FTC $53k/violation): first-party, named consent only; centralized DNC; compliant dialer/SMS; vendor audits.</li>
<li><strong>Vicarious liability</strong> (Hossfeld): liability for vendor chains; require consent proof; terminate non-compliant sources; document due diligence.</li>
<li><strong>Dual-standard rollover risk</strong>: apply DOL fiduciary workflow + PTE plus NAIC BI; dual documentation stored.</li>
<li><strong>Replacements/twisting</strong>: enforce replacement forms; suitability checks; supervisor review; persistency monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Data/privacy breaches</strong>: follow NAIC #668/GLBA safeguards; vendor management; incident response; encryption/MFA.</li>
<li><strong>Securities/FINRA</strong>: pre-review communications; avoid promissory/testimonials; social media adoption rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term (0–90 days)</strong>: Stand up centralized consent/DNC system; enforce call/SMS time windows; update web forms with one-to-one consent; audit/terminate aggregator/aged lead vendors; enable universal call/meeting recording for Medicare/ACA; implement replacement and BI documentation packets.</li>
<li><strong>Medium-term (6–12 months)</strong>: Build dual-standard (DOL + NAIC) workflow for rollover-funded annuities/IUL; deploy CE/product-qualification tracking; implement NAIC #668-style security program; formal ad/communications review; onboard compliant SMS/e-sign with BAA.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term (1–2 years)</strong>: Embed compliance into tech stack (CRM/AMS with consent/DNC logs, recording, BI docs); periodic vendor audits; ongoing role-based training (TCPA, BI, AML, DOL, privacy); continuous monitoring of persistency, complaints, and replacements as risk signals.</li>
</ul>
